Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The brain regions will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary. \n \nHere are some examples:\n--- \nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Medial Prefrontal Cortex; Left Inferior Parietal Lobule; Left Inferior Temporal Gyrus; Occipital Lobe; Basal Ganglia; Right Temporoparietal Junction; Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n\nLeft Inferior Parietal Lobule: \"We need to use the numbers 6, 12, 1, and 1 to make 24 by applying basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). Numerically, 12 and 6 have a useful relationship with division and multiplication, but we should also explore other combinations. Let\u2019s start working on it.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Okay, here\u2019s my first attempt: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24.\"\nLeft Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s break that down: (1 + 1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, and 6 * 6 equals 36. This overshoots the target of 24. We need to rethink this strategy and try a different approach.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"Visually, I see that multiplying 6 by itself gives a result that\u2019s too large. We might need to start with smaller numbers to gradually build up to 24.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! I\u2019ll try a new solution: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\"\nLeft Inferior Temporal Gyrus: \"Wait a second, the number 4 isn\u2019t in the set we\u2019re allowed to use. We can only work with the numbers 6, 12, 1, and 1. Let\u2019s stick to those.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Right, I forgot about that. I\u2019ll adjust the solution: how about 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24?\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"You're getting close, but the subtraction makes the multiplication result in zero, which isn't helpful. Let\u2019s try using addition instead of subtraction.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! How about this solution: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24?\"\nMedial Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s check: (1 + 1) = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, and 12 + 12 equals 24. This solution is correct, and it uses all the given numbers properly.\"\nAnterior Cingulate Cortex: \"Everything checks out, there are no errors in this calculation. The problem has been solved!\"\nRight Temporoparietal Junction: \"The sequence of operations is also correct, and the calculations flow in the right order. We\u2019ve done it!\"\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24.\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid. \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Medial Prefrontal Cortex; Left Inferior Parietal Lobule; Left Inferior Temporal Gyrus; Occipital Lobe; Basal Ganglia; Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n\nLeft Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s start by considering the structural requirements for this poem. It needs to have seven lines, and the first letters of each line should form the word 'CHATGPT.' In addition, the content must explain a quantum computer in simple terms, suitable for a ten-year-old.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the guidance! Here\u2019s my initial attempt at the poem:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGreat power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\"\n\nMedial Prefrontal Cortex: \"The poem has a nice structure and flow, but the language might be a little too complex for a child. For example, 'perplex' may be too difficult. Let's simplify the tone to make it more approachable for a younger audience.\"\nLeft Inferior Temporal Gyrus: \"I agree with simplifying. We could use more familiar and relatable terms. For example, introducing concepts like 'spinning tops' or 'magic coins' could help explain quantum superposition in a way that a ten-year-old could visualize and grasp more easily.\"\nLeft Inferior Parietal Lobule: \"Instead of 'entwined in dual state,' we could say 'two states they embrace,' which is easier to understand while retaining the core quantum idea. Also, replacing 'haze' with 'puzzling maze' gives a clearer image.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"Visually, the words 'puzzling maze' create a clearer, more tangible image than 'haze,' which can be vague. Simplifying the imagery should help younger readers visualize what\u2019s happening in the poem.\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"Maintaining the acrostic structure while simplifying the language works well. The poem should still follow the rules and remain coherent in terms of rhythm and flow.\"\nAnterior Cingulate Cortex: \"Let\u2019s review the changes to ensure that everything aligns with the task\u2019s requirements and that the poem remains engaging. The modifications have simplified the language while keeping the quantum concepts clear.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for all the input! Here\u2019s the revised version of the poem:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\"\n\nLeft Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s check the structure: the first letters of each line spell 'CHATGPT,' which is correct. The simplified language works well and follows the given instructions.\"\nMedial Prefrontal Cortex: \"The tone now feels much more appropriate for a younger audience. It\u2019s simple enough for a ten-year-old and still gets the message across effectively.\"\nLeft Inferior Parietal Lobule: \"The concept of quantum computing is now explained in a clear, accessible way that children should find easy to understand.\"\nAnterior Cingulate Cortex: \"Everything looks good! The structure and content meet the task requirements, and the poem feels engaging and fun.\"\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

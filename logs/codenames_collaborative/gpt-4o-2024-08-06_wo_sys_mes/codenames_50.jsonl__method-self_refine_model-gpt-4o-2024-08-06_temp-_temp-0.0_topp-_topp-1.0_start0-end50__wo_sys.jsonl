However, the connection to \"door\" is not immediately clear, which could lead to confusion. The word \"sheep\" does not directly relate to \"door\" in a meaningful way, making the hint less effective.\n\nTo improve the answer, it would be beneficial to find a word that more clearly connects both \"door\" and \"wool.\" For example, \"farm\" could be a better hint, as farms are places where sheep (wool) are raised and often have doors (barn doors, gates, etc.). This provides a more balanced connection to both words.\n\nOverall, the quality of the answer could be improved by selecting a hint that has a more direct and clear association with both \"door\" and \"wool.\"\n---\nBased on your initial answer and the subsequent feedback, revise the answer.

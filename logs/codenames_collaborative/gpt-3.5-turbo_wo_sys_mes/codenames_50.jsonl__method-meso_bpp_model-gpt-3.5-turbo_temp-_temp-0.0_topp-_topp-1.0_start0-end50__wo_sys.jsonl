You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Superior Parietal Lobule; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Primary Visual Cortex; Hippocampus; Amygdala\n\nStart collaboration! \n\nSuperior Parietal Lobule: \"Let\u2019s analyze the task in detail. We need to use exactly the four numbers (6, 12, 1, 1) to construct 24. One approach is to consider common factors or combinations that can reach 24. For example, numbers like 12 and 6 are related by multiplication, but we should also explore addition or subtraction to hit the target.

Here\u2019s my initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24.\"\nDorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s break that down: (1 + 1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, and 6 * 6 = 36. This solution is incorrect as it results in 36, not 24. We need to consider different combinations and avoid division in this way.\"\nPrimary Visual Cortex: \"Visually, I see the error. Multiplying 6 by itself gives us too high of a result. Let\u2019s imagine breaking down 24 into smaller components first, like through addition. For instance, 12 + 12 equals 24.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\"\nHippocampus: \"Wait a minute, this is close, but you\u2019ve introduced a 4, which is not part of the original numbers. Let\u2019s avoid using extra numbers and stick strictly to the provided set: 6, 12, 1, and 1.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"You\u2019re right, I overlooked that. Here is a revised solution considering only the provided numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\"\nAmygdala: \"Hmm, I appreciate the effort, but you\u2019re very close! The subtraction might be causing the issue. Let\u2019s try changing it to an addition. Keep up the great work, we\u2019re almost there!\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! Here\u2019s the corrected solution: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24.\"\nSuperior Parietal Lobule: \"Let\u2019s check it step by step: 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, and 12 + 12 = 24.

For example, 'perplex' is a difficult word. Let\u2019s try to simplify the tone to make it more accessible.\"\nHippocampus: \"I agree with simplifying it. Also, using relatable concepts like 'spinning tops' or 'magic coins' could help explain quantum superposition in a way that children can understand.\"\nAngular Gyrus: \"Instead of 'entwined in dual state,' we could say 'two states they embrace,' which is simpler and still retains the quantum concept. Also, 'puzzling maze' might replace 'haze' for a clearer visual.\"\nAmygdala: \"I think simplifying the language will make the poem more emotionally engaging for children.

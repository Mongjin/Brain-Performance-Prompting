The brain regions will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n--- \nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Superior Parietal Lobule; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Primary Visual Cortex; Hippocampus; Amygdala\n\nStart collaboration! \n\nSuperior Parietal Lobule: \"Let\u2019s analyze the task in detail. We need to use exactly the four numbers (6, 12, 1, 1) to construct 24. One approach is to consider common factors or combinations that can reach 24. For example, numbers like 12 and 6 are related by multiplication, but we should also explore addition or subtraction to hit the target. Let\u2019s try to construct potential solutions step by step.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the guidance! Here\u2019s my initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24.\"\nDorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s break that down: (1 + 1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, and 6 * 6 = 36. This solution is incorrect as it results in 36, not 24. We need to consider different combinations and avoid division in this way.\"\nPrimary Visual Cortex: \"Visually, I see the error. Multiplying 6 by itself gives us too high of a result. Let\u2019s imagine breaking down 24 into smaller components first, like through addition. For instance, 12 + 12 equals 24.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\"\nHippocampus: \"Wait a minute, this is close, but you\u2019ve introduced a 4, which is not part of the original numbers. Let\u2019s avoid using extra numbers and stick strictly to the provided set: 6, 12, 1, and 1.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"You\u2019re right, I overlooked that. Here is a revised solution considering only the provided numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\"\nAmygdala: \"Hmm, I appreciate the effort, but you\u2019re very close! The subtraction might be causing the issue. Let\u2019s try changing it to an addition. Keep up the great work, we\u2019re almost there!\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! Here\u2019s the corrected solution: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24.\"\nSuperior Parietal Lobule: \"Let\u2019s check it step by step: 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, and 12 + 12 = 24. The solution works, and all the numbers were used correctly.\"\nAmygdala: \"Great job! This feels satisfying now that we\u2019ve nailed it. Excellent teamwork!\"\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24.\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid. \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Temporal Lobe; Limbic System; Occipital Lobe; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"We need to organize the poem into seven lines, with the first letters spelling 'CHATGPT.' The language should be simple enough for a ten-year-old, and we need to include basic explanations of quantum computing.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Let\u2019s recall the basics of quantum computing: it\u2019s a type of computer that uses qubits, allowing multiple states at once, unlike classical bits. I\u2019ll provide this key information for the poem.\"\nHippocampus: \"I recall some basic metaphors used in the past to explain complex ideas to children. Let\u2019s use some of those to simplify the explanation.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"We should include vivid imagery to make the poem engaging. For example, comparing qubits to spinning tops or magic coins might help.\"\nLimbic System: \"Let\u2019s ensure the poem is fun and interesting for a child. Using playful words and a light tone will keep them engaged.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the input! Here\u2019s my first attempt:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm\u2019s odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\"\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"The structure looks correct. The first letters spell out 'CHATGPT,' and the poem stays focused on the topic.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Good job! The information about quantum computing is accurate, but I think we can simplify it a bit more for children.\"\nLimbic System: \"The tone feels light, but we could make it even more playful. Maybe add a bit more fun language.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! I\u2019ll simplify and adjust the tone. Let me revise it:\nCurious machine, what a wonder!\nHarnessing strange quantum thunder,\nAtoms play, two states they juggle,\nTaking secrets with a giggle.\n\nGreat at solving, fast and neat,\nPuzzles that no one else can beat,\nTomorrow's future, what a treat!\"\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"This version also maintains the structure with 'CHATGPT.' The tone feels lighter and more playful.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"I agree. The explanation is even simpler now, and the playful language makes it more engaging for a child.\"\nHippocampus: \"I like how this reflects previous simple metaphors that work well for children. The playful nature helps.\"\nLimbic System: \"I love the playful tone! It's much more fun and engaging now.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"The imagery is vivid and clear, especially with 'juggling' and 'secrets.' This should help kids visualize the concept better.\"\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine, what a wonder!\nHarnessing strange quantum thunder,\nAtoms play, two states they juggle,\nTaking secrets with a giggle.\n\nGreat at solving, fast and neat,\nPuzzles that no one else can beat,\nTomorrow's future, what a treat!\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants and collaboratively solve the following task step by step. Remember to provide the final solution with the following format \"Final answer: (a list of words here).\".\n\nTask: Try to identify the 2 words best associated with the word \"net\" from the following list: dragon, kangaroo, lock, jam, battery, centaur, pilot, calf, web, australia, jack, spell, ruler, table.

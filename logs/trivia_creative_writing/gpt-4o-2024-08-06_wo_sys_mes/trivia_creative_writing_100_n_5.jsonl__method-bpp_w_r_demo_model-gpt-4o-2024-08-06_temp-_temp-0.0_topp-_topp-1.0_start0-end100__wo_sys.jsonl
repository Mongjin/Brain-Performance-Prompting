One sunny afternoon, while exploring the dusty attic of his grandmother's house, he stumbled upon an old scrapbook filled with newspaper clippings and photographs.\n\nThe first clipping was about Katrina and the Waves, the band that brought joy to the United Kingdom by winning the Eurovision Song Contest with 'Love Shine A Light.' Inspired by their story of triumph, Alex decided to form a band with his friends, hoping to spread joy in Sandlot.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages, Alex found an article about a historic soccer match where Australia defeated American Samoa 31-0. Although Australia didn't qualify for the World Cup, their determination resonated with Alex, teaching him that success isn't always about the final outcome but the effort put in.\n\nNext, Alex discovered a picture of Roland Rat and his gerbil friend, Kevin. This reminded him of the importance of friendship and loyalty, values he cherished deeply.\n\nFurther along, Alex read about elephants, the majestic creatures with the longest gestation period of 22 months. This fact fascinated him, symbolizing patience and the beauty of nature's processes.\n\nFinally, Alex came across a story about Steve Bing, who had a complicated relationship with Elizabeth Hurley. This tale of misunderstanding and eventual truth taught Alex about the complexities of human relationships and the importance of honesty.\n\nWith each discovery, Alex felt more connected to the world around him.

Their journey began when they stumbled upon an old, dusty book titled 'The Wealth of Nations' by Adam Smith. Intrigued by the tales of trade and prosperity, they decided to explore further.\n\nTheir first stop was a peculiar pub with a sign that stretched across the entire street. The sign read, 'The Old Thirteenth Cheshire Astley Volunteer Rifleman Corps Inn,' boasting a whopping 55 letters. Inside, they met a mysterious figure who introduced himself as The Lone Ranger, a legendary cowboy created by George W. Trendle. He regaled them with stories of justice and bravery in the Wild West.\n\nInspired by The Lone Ranger's tales, the Cabbage Patch Kids continued their journey and found themselves in a bustling city. There, they attended a film screening of 'Dressed to Kill,' where they were captivated by Michael Caine's thrilling performance as a psychiatrist with a dark secret.\n\nAs they traveled further, they heard whispers of a legendary football match from 1961. They learned about Denis Law, a remarkable player who scored six goals in a single game but still faced defeat. The story taught them about perseverance and the unpredictable nature of life.\n\nWith their hearts full of stories and lessons, the Cabbage Patch Kids returned home, eager to share their newfound knowledge with their friends.

Tony, ever the storyteller, began with a tale of the infamous Altamont Speedway concert, where the Rolling Stones played amidst chaos and history was made. The audience listened intently, their imaginations ignited by the vivid narrative.\n\nAs the film played, Tony couldn't help but draw parallels between the daring heists of 'The Italian Job' and the daily adventures of life in Madagascar. The night sky, clear and vast, reminded him of the 8 minutes and 20 seconds it takes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, a testament to the wonders of the universe.\n\nAfter the screening, the villagers gathered around a feast, sharing stories and laughter. Among the dishes was a delightful pasta salad featuring Anellini, its ring-shaped form symbolizing the unity and connection of their community.\n\nIn that moment, Tony realized that stories, much like the rings of Anellini, have the power to bring people together, transcending time and space, much like the light from the Sun reaching the Earth."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was the first name of the character played by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.", "In which 1969 movie did Michael Caine appear with his brother Stanley.", "In 1969, a man was stabbed to death by a member of the Hell's Angels at a Rolling Stones concert.

The riddle was a humorous line: \"Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?\"\n\nWith a twinkle in her eye, the Princess cleverly answered, \"I shall come quietly, for the sound of learning is music to my ears.\" With her answer, the spell was broken, and the frog transformed into a charming prince.\n\nTogether, they embarked on many adventures, always cherishing the lessons learned at St. Trinian's and the magical bond they shared."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was the capital of the United States between 1785 and 1790??", "Which fictional girls' boarding school was created by the cartoonist Ronald Searle", "Who played the character Mr Chips in the 2002 TV adaptation of Goodbye Mr Chips", "Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?", "Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?"], "answers": [["New Yourk State", "State of N.Y.", "US-NY", "N Y", "The state of NY", "NewYork", "NYS", "Neo York", "NY state", "Nova York", "State of new york", "Ny", "New york", "Nueva York (estado)", "N Y state", "New York (state)", "U.S. state of New York", "New York state", "New York, U.S.", "State New York", "N\u00fdja-J\u00f3rv\u00edk", "Newyork", "NEW YORK", "State of N.

First, Wall-E stumbled upon the tale of Pete Best, the original drummer of the Beatles. Wall-E learned how Pete's journey took a different path when Ringo Starr joined the band, reminding Wall-E of the importance of resilience and adaptation. Next, Wall-E traveled to the early 20th century, witnessing the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II. This event taught Wall-E about the complexities of leadership and the impact of monumental decisions on history. In a dramatic twist, Wall-E found himself in ancient Rome, observing the betrayal of Julius Caesar. The famous words 'Et tu, Brute?' echoed in Wall-E's circuits, highlighting themes of loyalty and trust. Wall-E's journey continued to the world of theater, where he watched Hamlet's tragic story unfold. The introspective nature of Hamlet's character resonated with Wall-E, encouraging him to reflect on his own purpose. Finally, Wall-E arrived in the golden age of cinema, meeting Charlie Chaplin, one of the founders of United Artists. Inspired by Chaplin's creativity and innovation, Wall-E realized the power of art to bring joy and change to the world. Wall-E's adventure through these stories enriched his understanding of humanity, leaving him with a newfound appreciation for history, art, and the enduring spirit of creativity."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who was sacked as the Beatles' drummer and replaced by Ringo Starr?", "Tsar Nicholas I abidacated in 1917, who was the other monarch to abdicate during this period?", "Whose last words were Et Tu Brute according to Shakespeare?", "Mel Gibson (1990) and Kenneth Branagh (1996) have both played which character in movies?", "The original United Artists film studio was founded in 1919 by D.W.

With the Tornado's help, Aladdin reached a hidden oasis where he was greeted by six geese a-laying, a gift from his true love on the Sixth Day of Christmas. The geese revealed the path to the Tempest, but only if Aladdin could demonstrate his agility and grace. Channeling the spirit of Louis Smith, Aladdin performed a flawless routine on the pommel horse, impressing the geese and earning their guidance. Finally, Aladdin reached the Tempest and unlocked its secrets, gaining the wisdom he sought.

As he wandered through the trees, he stumbled upon a wise old owl who spoke of tales from distant lands. The owl, much like the legendary commentator Peter O\u2019Sullevan, narrated stories of majestic horse races that took place in the open meadows.\n\nFurther along his journey, Bambi met a group of singing birds perched on a branch. They chirped a melody from an album called \u2018The Queen is Dead\u2019 by The Smiths, filling the air with harmonious tunes. Intrigued by the music, Bambi continued his exploration.\n\nIn the heart of the forest, Bambi discovered a quaint little cottage. The cottage, much like Downing Street, was described by a passing squirrel as \u2018One of the most precious jewels in the national heritage,\u2019 echoing the words of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting a golden hue over the forest, Bambi encountered a playful bear named Antigonus, who shared stories from Shakespeare's 'The Winter's Tale'. Together, they laughed and played until the stars twinkled in the night sky.\n\nAnd so, Bambi's adventure came to an end, filled with new friends and stories that would stay with him forever."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Author J.R.R.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Superior Parietal Lobule; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Primary Visual Cortex; Hippocampus; Amygdala\n\nStart collaboration! \n\nSuperior Parietal Lobule: \"Let\u2019s analyze the task in detail. We need to use exactly the four numbers (6, 12, 1, 1) to construct 24. One approach is to consider common factors or combinations that can reach 24. For example, numbers like 12 and 6 are related by multiplication, but we should also explore addition or subtraction to hit the target. Let\u2019s try to construct potential solutions step by step.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the guidance! Here\u2019s my initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24.\"\nDorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s break that down: (1 + 1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, and 6 * 6 = 36. This solution is incorrect as it results in 36, not 24. We need to consider different combinations and avoid division in this way.\"\nPrimary Visual Cortex: \"Visually, I see the error. Multiplying 6 by itself gives us too high of a result. Let\u2019s imagine breaking down 24 into smaller components first, like through addition. For instance, 12 + 12 equals 24.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\"\nHippocampus: \"Wait a minute, this is close, but you\u2019ve introduced a 4, which is not part of the original numbers. Let\u2019s avoid using extra numbers and stick strictly to the provided set: 6, 12, 1, and 1.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"You\u2019re right, I overlooked that. Here is a revised solution considering only the provided numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\"\nAmygdala: \"Hmm, I appreciate the effort, but you\u2019re very close! The subtraction might be causing the issue. Let\u2019s try changing it to an addition. Keep up the great work, we\u2019re almost there!\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! Here\u2019s the corrected solution: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24.\"\nSuperior Parietal Lobule: \"Let\u2019s check it step by step: 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, and 12 + 12 = 24. The solution works, and all the numbers were used correctly.\"\nAmygdala: \"Great job! This feels satisfying now that we\u2019ve nailed it. Excellent teamwork!\"\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants and collaboratively solve the following task step by step. Remember to present your final solution with the prefix \"Final answer:\".\n\nTask: Write a short and coherent story about Bolt that incorporates the answers to the following 5 questions: What is the name of the steam locomotive which set the world speed record in July 1938 by reaching 126 mph on the East Coast Mainline  in England? Singer and musician Bono called which venue \u2018Rock and roll\u2019s great cathedral\u2019? Which 5th/6th Century Buddhist monk is described in Chinese texts as \u2018The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\u2019? Which year saw the only hijacking of a British commercial flight? What was the name of the Cunard ocean liner which was launched on 20th September 1906?\n"}], "unwrapped_output": ["Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled along the East Coast Mainline in England, there lived a young and curious boy named Bolt. Fascinated by the tales of speed and adventure, Bolt often dreamt of the legendary steam locomotive, the 'Mallard,' which had set the world speed record in 1938. His heart raced with excitement at the thought of such velocity and innovation.\n\nOne day, Bolt's grandfather, a retired railway engineer, took him on a trip to the bustling city of New York. There, they visited the iconic 'Madison Square Garden,' which Bono had famously called 'Rock and roll\u2019s great cathedral.' The energy and history of the venue filled Bolt with awe, igniting a passion for music and performance.\n\nAs they traveled, Bolt's grandfather shared stories of the ancient monk 'Bodhidharma,' known as \u2018The Blue-Eyed Barbarian.\u2019 He spoke of Bodhidharma's journey to spread wisdom and enlightenment, inspiring Bolt to seek knowledge and understanding in his own life.\n\nTheir journey continued, and Bolt learned about the year 1971, when the only hijacking of a British commercial flight took place. The tale of courage and resilience in the face of adversity left a lasting impression on him, teaching him the value of bravery and determination.\n\nFinally, they embarked on a voyage aboard the majestic 'RMS Mauretania,' the Cunard ocean liner launched in 1906. As the ship sailed across the vast ocean, Bolt felt a sense of wonder and adventure, dreaming of the endless possibilities that lay ahead.\n\nThrough these experiences, Bolt discovered that life is a journey filled with speed, music, wisdom, courage, and adventure. Inspired by the past, he set forth on his own path, ready to make his mark on the world."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What is the name of the steam locomotive which set the world speed record in July 1938 by reaching 126 mph on the East Coast Mainline  in England?", "Singer and musician Bono called which venue \u2018Rock and roll\u2019s great cathedral\u2019?", "Which 5th/6th Century Buddhist monk is described in Chinese texts as \u2018The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\u2019?", "Which year saw the only hijacking of a British commercial flight?", "What was the name of the Cunard ocean liner which was launched on 20th September 1906?"], "answers": [["Mallard Duck", "Mallards", "Platyrhynchos", "Mallard duck", "Anas platyrhynchos", "Anas boschas", "Mallard", "Wild Duck", "Stock Duck", "Wild Ducks", "Mallard ducks", "anas platyrhynchos", "mallard ducks", "anas boschas", "mallards", "wild duck", "stock duck", "mallard", "mallard duck", "platyrhynchos", "wild ducks"], ["Madison square garden", "Madison Square Garden IV", "The MSG", "M.S.G.", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Square Gardens", "Theatre at Madison Square", "Gilmores Garden", "Madison Square Garden 4", "Madison Square Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals Series of 1994", "MSG IV", "The M.S.G.", "Madison Square Garden (1968)", "Knicks-Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Madison Square Garden Training Center", "knicks rangers finals series of 1994", "m s g", "knicks\u2013rangers championship runs of 1994", "knicks\u2013rangers finals series of 1994", "madison garden", "msg iv", "madison square garden 1968", "madison square garden iv", "madison square garden training center", "madison square garden", "madison square gardens", "theatre at madison square", "knicks rangers championship runs of 1994", "gilmores garden", "msg", "madison square garden 4"], ["Da mo", "Bodhi-Dharma", "Tamo", "Bodidarma", "Bodhiharma", "Da Mo's cave", "Bodhidarma", "Bodhi Dharma", "Bodhidharma at Shaolin", "Bloodstream Sermon", "Bodhidharma", "bodidarma", "da mo s cave", "bodhidarma", "bloodstream sermon", "bodhi dharma", "tamo", "da mo", "bodhiharma", "bodhidharma", "bodhidharma at shaolin"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and seventy", "1970", "1970", "one thousand nine hundred and seventy"], ["Domain of Moor", "Mauretania Secunda", "Roman Mauretania", "Mauretanian Kingdom", "Ancient mauretania", "Kingdom of Mauretania", "Roman-Moorish kingdoms", "Roman-Moor Kingdoms", "Mauretania Prima", "List of Kings of Mauretania", "King of Mauretania", "Classical mauretania", "Mauretania Sitifensis", "Classical morocco", "Mauretania", "List of kings of Mauretania", "Sitifensis", "mauretania prima", "domain of moor", "classical morocco", "sitifensis", "king of mauretania", "mauretanian kingdom", "list of kings of mauretania", "roman moorish kingdoms", "roman moor kingdoms", "ancient mauretania", "classical mauretania", "mauretania sitifensis", "mauretania secunda", "kingdom of mauretania", "roman mauretania", "mauretania"]], "question_ids": ["qb_404", "qb_406", "qb_470", "qb_483", "qb_495"], "topic": "Bolt"}}

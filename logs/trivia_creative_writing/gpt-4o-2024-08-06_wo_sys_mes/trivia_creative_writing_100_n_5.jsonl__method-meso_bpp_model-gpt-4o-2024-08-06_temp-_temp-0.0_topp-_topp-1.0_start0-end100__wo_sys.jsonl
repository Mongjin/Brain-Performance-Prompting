As he dusted it off and turned the dial, a voice crackled through the static: 'To err is human but it feels divine,' said Mae West. Intrigued by the mysterious voice, the Grinch decided to keep listening.\n\nSoon, the radio played a catchy tune, 'Roses Are Red,' sung by Bobby Vinton. The melody was so enchanting that it made the Grinch tap his furry green foot. Inspired by the music, he felt a strange urge to explore beyond his mountain.\n\nWith a newfound sense of adventure, the Grinch set off in his sleigh, marked with the letters 'IS' for Iceland, a souvenir from a past escapade. His journey took him to the bustling city of Philadelphia, where he stumbled upon the grand John F. Kennedy Stadium, the site of the legendary Live Aid concert.\n\nAs he wandered through the empty stadium, the Grinch imagined the energy of the crowd and the power of music to bring people together. It reminded him of the longest moon landing, Apollo 17, and the incredible feats humans could achieve when united.\n\nBy the end of his journey, the Grinch realized that even he, with his grumpy heart, could find joy in the world\u2019s wonders. With a smile, he returned to his cave, the radio still playing softly, and decided that maybe, just maybe, he could let a little more music into his life."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["\"Who said, To err is human but it feels divine?\"\"\"", "Which singer had a big 60s No 1 with Roses Are Red?", "What are the international registration letters of a vehicle from Iceland?", "Where was the American venue of the Live Aid concert?", "Which was the longest moon landing?"], "answers": [["Mae West", "Mae west", "Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me%3F", "When I'm Bad, I'm Better", "Jane Mast", "When I'm good, I'm very good...", "Mae West filmography", "mae west filmography", "is that gun in your pocket or are you just happy to see me 3f", "mae west", "when i m bad i m better", "when i m good i m very good", "jane mast"], ["Bobby Vinton", "bobby vinton"], ["I S", "I.s.", "IS", "I.S.", "Is.", "IS (disambiguation)", "Is", "is", "i s", "is disambiguation"], ["Philedelphia", "City of brotherly love", "City of Brotherly Love", "The Quaker City", "Philadelphia", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.", "Philadelphia, Pa.", "List of nicknames for Philadelphia", "Philidalphia", "Philadelphia, United States", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.", "Philadelphia PA", "Philadelphia Suburban Rail", "Philadelphi", "Philadelphia, U.S.", "Philadelphia Regional Rail", "The City of Brotherly Love", "City of Philadelphia", "Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)", "Wiccacoa", "Philadelpia, Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia, USA", "Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania", "Government of Philadelphia", "Philadelphia (PA)", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA", "Philadelphia (City)", "UN/LOCODE:USPHL", "The City That Loves You Back", "Philadelphia (Pa.)", "Phila.", "The Cradle of Liberty", "The city of brotherly love", "Philadelphia (city, Pennsylvania)", "Philidelphia", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US", "Philadelphia Commuter Rail", "The City and County of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Philadephia, Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia City", "Philadelphia Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia City Controller", "Philladelphia", "Political families of Philadelphia", "Philadelphia, Pa", "Philadelphia, PA", "The Birthplace of America", "Philadelpia, PA", "birthplace of america", "philadelpia pa", "philadelphia pennsylvania u s", "un locode usphl", "philadephia pennsylvania", "government of philadelphia", "city and county of philadelphia pennsylvania", "philidelphia", "philadelphia commuter rail", "philedelphia", "philladelphia", "philadelphia pa", "philadelpia pennsylvania", "philadelphia city", "philadelphia", "philadelphia pennsylvania us", "philadelphia pennsylvania", "political families of philadelphia", "philadelphia regional rail", "list of nicknames for philadelphia", "philadelphi", "phila", "philadelphia u s", "philadelphia suburban rail", "cradle of liberty", "philidalphia", "philadelphia usa", "city that loves you back", "philadelphia city pennsylvania", "city of brotherly love", "wiccacoa", "philadelphia united states", "philadelphia philadelphia county pennsylvania", "philadelphia city controller", "quaker city", "city of philadelphia", "philadelphia pennsylvania usa"], ["Apollo 17", "Apollo XVII", "Apollo17", "apollo xvii", "apollo17", "apollo 17"]], "question_ids": ["tc_2182", "tc_2191", "tc_2202", "tc_2208", "tc_2218"], "topic": "Grinch"}}

There, she met a charming banker named Mary Poppins, who gave her a magical umbrella to help her on her quest.\n\nAs Strawberry continued her journey, she stumbled upon a lively radio station run by the energetic Adrian Cronauer. His cheerful 'Good Morning, Berryville!' broadcasts filled the air with laughter and music, lifting Strawberry's spirits and guiding her to her next destination.\n\nIn the Enchanted Forest, Strawberry encountered the stylish and eccentric Cruella de Vil, who surprisingly had a soft spot for strawberries. Cruella shared her fashion tips, helping Strawberry create a dazzling outfit for her adventure.\n\nFurther along, Strawberry met the wise director Billy Wilder, who was filming a movie about the Sweetness Stone. He shared stories of his adventures, inspiring Strawberry to persevere in her quest.\n\nFinally, Strawberry arrived at the grand Berryville Theater, where a comedy show was in full swing. The star of the show, Jack Dee, had everyone in stitches with his jokes. He presented Strawberry with a map leading to the Sweetness Stone, hidden in the heart of Berryville.\n\nWith the help of her new friends, Strawberry Shortcake found the Sweetness Stone and returned to her friends in Strawberryland, spreading joy and laughter throughout the land."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which film features the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank?", "What is Robin Williams character called in Good Morning Vietnam?", "Who plays Cruella de Vil in the 1996 live action version of 101 Dalmations?", "Marilyn Monroe starred in the Seven Year Itch.

This inspired Hiccup to push beyond his limits.\n\nNext, Hiccup encountered the legendary fast bowler Allan Donald, known as 'White Lightning.' Donald's speed and precision taught Hiccup the value of agility and focus, crucial skills for a dragon rider.\n\nAs Hiccup climbed the treacherous Dragon's Peak, he remembered the story of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the first to summit Mount Everest in 1953. Their courage and teamwork inspired Hiccup to trust in Toothless and work together to overcome any obstacle.\n\nIn a surprising twist, Hiccup found himself in a dream where he was coached by Goldie Hawn's character from the 1986 film 'Wildcats.' She taught him the importance of leadership and believing in his team, skills essential for guiding Toothless.\n\nFinally, Hiccup learned from the tales of Christopher Columbus, the explorer with ships named Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria. Columbus's adventurous spirit and determination to explore the unknown encouraged Hiccup to venture into uncharted skies with Toothless.\n\nWith these lessons, Hiccup and Toothless soared to new heights, proving that with courage, focus, teamwork, leadership, and a spirit of adventure, any dragon can be trained."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who in 1975 became the first black man to win a Wimbledon singles title?", "Which South African fast bowler had the nickname White Lightning", "In 1953, Edmund Hillary was half of the famous pair to first do what?", "1986 film starring Goldie Hawn as a High School football coach.", "Which Italian explorer had ships named Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria?"], "answers": [["Arthur Ashe, Jr.", "Arthur Robert Ashe, Jr.", "Ashe, Arthur Robert", "Arthur ash", "Arthur R.

Her adventure began at Hever Castle, the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, the enigmatic queen consort of England. As Emily wandered through the castle's ancient halls, she imagined the life of the queen who once graced these very rooms.\n\nInspired by the past, Emily set her sights on unraveling more mysteries. Her next stop was a vintage car show, where she marveled at a bright orange Bond Bug, a quirky three-wheeled car from the 1970s. Its unique design and vibrant color sparked her curiosity about the era's innovative spirit.\n\nDriven by her thirst for knowledge, Emily traveled to a maritime museum, where she encountered the legendary Calypso, Jacques Cousteau's mobile oceanographic laboratory. The stories of Cousteau's underwater explorations filled her with awe and a desire to protect the oceans.\n\nHer journey then took her to a bustling city, where she witnessed the impressive sight of Marine One, the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States. The sight of the helicopter soaring through the sky symbolized the pinnacle of modern technology and leadership.\n\nFinally, Emily's adventure led her to a financial museum, where she learned about Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, who bought the first Premium Bond in 1956. This innovative financial instrument represented a new era of investment and opportunity.\n\nAs Emily reflected on her journey, she realized that each element, from historical figures to technological marvels, was a thread in the rich tapestry of human achievement.

One day, he stumbled upon an ancient archive, its dusty records whispering tales of the past. As Wall-E sifted through the pages, he discovered the story of Pete Best, the original drummer of a legendary band called the Beatles, who was replaced by Ringo Starr. Wall-E imagined the rhythm of their music, a melody echoing through time.\n\nAnother tale spoke of the year 1917, a time of great change, when Tsar Nicholas II and King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria both abdicated their thrones. Wall-E pondered the weight of such decisions, the echoes of power and change resonating in his circuits.\n\nAs he continued exploring, Wall-E found a dramatic account of Julius Caesar's betrayal, with his last words, 'Et tu, Brute?' etched in history. The story of loyalty and betrayal intrigued the little robot, sparking thoughts of trust and friendship.\n\nWall-E also discovered the timeless character of Hamlet, brought to life by actors like Mel Gibson and Kenneth Branagh. The robot marveled at the complexity of human emotions, the timeless nature of Shakespeare's works stirring his mechanical heart.\n\nFinally, Wall-E learned about the founding of the United Artists film studio in 1919 by visionaries like D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin. Wall-E marveled at their creativity, the legacy of their films a testament to human imagination.\n\nWith each story, Wall-E felt a deeper connection to the humans who once inhabited the Earth, understanding their triumphs, struggles, and creativity.

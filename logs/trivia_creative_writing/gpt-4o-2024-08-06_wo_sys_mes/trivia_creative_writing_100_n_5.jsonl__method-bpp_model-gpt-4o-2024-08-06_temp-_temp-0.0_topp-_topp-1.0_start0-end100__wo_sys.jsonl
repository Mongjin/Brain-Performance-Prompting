Presley joined Bilbo, and together they ventured into the enchanted forest, where they discovered a beautiful dress designed by the renowned Catherine Walker, shimmering in the moonlight.\n\nTheir adventure took them to a hidden valley, where they met a mysterious figure named Yasser, who spoke of his quest to co-found a group called al Fatah in 1957, seeking peace and unity.\n\nWith newfound friends and stories, Bilbo returned to the Shire, his heart full of memories and his mind buzzing with the tales of the world beyond his home."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 2, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp4", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was Blondie's last UK No 1 of the 80s?", "In which decade of the 20th century was Anne Bancroft born?", "Which rock star did Cindy Crawford name her first son after?", "Who designed the dress which made the most at Diana's dress auction?", "Which Palestinian co-founded al Fatah in 1957?"], "answers": [["Midtribulation rapture", "Midtribulationism", "Pre-tribulation", "Pre-tribulation rapture", "Rapture", "Pretribulation rapture", "Mid-tribulation rapture", "Rapture (Protestant belief)", "The Teaching of the rapture", "Pretribulationistism", "Pre Tribulation", "Pre-tribulational", "Pre-trib", "teaching of rapture", "pre tribulation rapture", "rapture protestant belief", "midtribulation rapture", "rapture", "pretribulation rapture", "pre tribulational", "mid tribulation rapture", "midtribulationism", "pretribulationistism", "pre trib", "pre tribulation"], ["1930\u2019s", "Thirties", "1930s literature", "Nineteen-thirties", "1930\u20131939", "1930-1939", "'30s", "1930s", "1930's", "%6030s", "1930s (decade)", "The Thirties", "1930\u20131939", "30s", "nineteen thirties", "1930 1939", "thirties", "1930s literature", "1930s decade", "1930s", "1930 s", "6030s"], ["Presley", "Pressley", "Pressly", "pressly", "presley", "pressley"], ["Victor Edelstein", "victor edelstein"], ["Yasir Arafat", "Yasir 'Arafat", "Jassir Arafat", "Abu Ammar", "Yasser 'Arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "Ab\u016b %60amm\u0101r", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat Al Qudua Al Husseini", "Yaser Arafat", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Ashraf al-Kurdi", "Muhammad Abd ar-Rauf al-Qudwah al-Husayni", "Abu Amar", "Mohammed Abdel-Raouf Arafat As Qudwa al-Hussaeini", "Death of yasser arafat", "Yasser Arafet", "Yasser Arafat", "Death Of Yasser Arafat", "Yassir Arafat", "Death of Arafat", "Muhammed al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Yasir Arafat (Disambiguation)", "Illness of Yasser Arafat", "Yassar Arafat", "death of yasser arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "yasir arafat disambiguation", "ab\u016b 60amm\u0101r", "yassir arafat", "illness of yasser arafat", "yassar arafat", "abu ammar", "muhammed al qudwa al husseini", "yasir arafat", "ashraf al kurdi", "muhammad abd ar rauf al qudwah al husayni", "yasser arafet", "yasser arafat", "yaser arafat", "mohammed abdel raouf arafat as qudwa al hussaeini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudua al husseini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudwa al husseini", "death of arafat", "jassir arafat", "abu amar"]], "question_ids": ["tc_1826", "tc_1865", "tc_1888", "tc_1921", "tc_1924"], "topic": "Hobbit"}}

Chloe the cat, always the strategist, explained the 'first-past-the-post' system, much to the amusement of her friends.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they stumbled upon a portrait of Catherine Parr, the wife of Henry VIII who had married four times. Buddy the dachshund, ever the romantic, mused about the complexities of love and history.\n\nFinally, the pets ended their adventure in a quaint Parisian caf\u00e9, where they listened to the enchanting voice of Edith Piaf, 'The Little Sparrow.' Mel the pug couldn't help but dance along, his tail wagging to the rhythm of the music.\n\nWith their adventure complete, the pets returned home, their minds filled with stories and their hearts full

As he watched the zebra race around the track, he was reminded of the thrilling horse races he read about in Dick Francis novels.\n\nLater, while taking a break, Daniel picked up a copy of The Sunday Post, a Scottish newspaper. He chuckled at the antics of the Broons and Oor Wullie, feeling a sense of camaraderie with their playful spirit.\n\nAs the day turned to evening, Daniel heard a familiar tune playing in the background. It was 'Christmas Alphabet,' a song that brought back memories of family gatherings and the funny line about 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle.'\n\nFeeling inspired, Daniel returned to his training with renewed energy. He remembered the dedication of Peter Shilton, the British footballer with the most International caps, and vowed to bring the same level of commitment to his karate practice.\n\nIn the end, Daniel learned that inspiration could come from the most unexpected places, whether it be a racing zebra, a newspaper comic, or a Christmas song."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp4", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What type of animal is the star of the 2005 film Racing Stripes?", "Author Dick Francis is famous for writing novels based around which sport?", "Which Scottish newspaper features the Broons and Oor Wullie?", "Which Christmas song includes the line It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle'?", "Which British footballer has the most number of International caps?"], "answers": [["Zevra", "Zebras", "Hippotigris", "Diseases in zebras", "Zebra", "Baby zebra", "ZEBRA", "hippotigris", "zebra", "baby zebra", "diseases in zebras", "zebras", "zevra"], ["Scratch sheet", "Race horse", "Pony racing", "Horse Racing", "Racing horse", "Racing industry", "Horse racing in Japan", "Horse-racing", "Keiba", "\ud83c\udfc7", "Horse racing", "Horse racing venue", "Racing on horseback", "Quarter-Horse Racing", "Horse race", "Horse races", "Racehorses", "Horse-race", "Racehorse", "Turf patron", "Horserace", "Horseracing", "horseracing", "horserace", "race horse", "horse races", "pony racing", "scratch sheet", "racehorse", "racing horse", "racehorses", "keiba", "horse racing", "horse racing venue", "horse racing in japan", "racing on horseback", "quarter horse racing", "horse race", "\ud83c\udfc7", "racing industry", "turf patron"], ["Sunday Post", "The Sunday Post", "sunday post"], ["All I Want for Christmas Is My 2 Front Teeth", "All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth", "All i want for christmas is my two front teeth", "All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth", "All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth", "all i want for christmas is my 2 front teeth", "all i want for christmas is my two front teeth"], ["Peter Leslie Shilton OBE", "Peter Shilton", "Peter Leslie Shilton", "peter leslie shilton obe", "peter leslie shilton", "peter shilton"]], "question_ids": ["qz_1730", "qz_1745", "qz_1794", "qz_1804", "qz_1821"], "topic": "Karate Kid"}}

The city was abuzz with excitement as the annual Zootopia History Festival was underway, celebrating notable figures and events from the past.\n\nJudy's investigation led her to the festival's main attraction, a series of exhibits dedicated to influential personalities. The first exhibit featured a hologram of Margaret Thatcher, famously known for her steadfastness, declaring, 'You turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning.' Judy admired Thatcher's determination, which reminded her of her own resolve to make a difference in Zootopia.\n\nNext, Judy encountered an exhibit about Cliff Thorburn, the snooker player known as 'The Grinder.' His perseverance in the game inspired Judy to keep pushing through her challenges, no matter how tough they seemed.\n\nAs she moved on, Judy found herself in front of a display honoring Michael Holding, the legendary West Indian fast bowler known as 'Whispering Death.' His speed and precision were qualities Judy aspired to in her police work.\n\nThe festival also featured a tribute to Ethel Skinner from Eastenders, known for her beloved dog, Willy. This reminded Judy of her own friendship with Nick Wilde, the sly fox who was always by her side.\n\nFinally, Judy learned about the year 1979, when the first episode of Minder aired. This year marked a time of change and new beginnings, much like Judy's own journey in Zootopia.\n\nWith renewed inspiration from these historical figures, Judy solved the case, proving once again that with determination and teamwork, anything is possible in Zootopia."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp4", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following success at the 1979 election whose party conference speeech included the lines 'you turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning'?", "Which snooker player was simply known as 'The Grinder'?", "Which former West Indian fast bowler was known as 'Whispering Death'?", "Which Eastenders character had a dog called Willy?", "In which year did the first episode of Minder take place?"], "answers": [["Baroness Margaret Thatcher", "Lady Thatcher", "Margret thatcher", "The Baroness Thatcher", "Margret Thatcher", "The Lady Thatcher", "Margaret Tatcher", "Margaret Thatcher", "Mrs T", "Mrs Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher", "Mrs. T", "Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven", "Margaret Thatcer", "Margaret Thatcher's", "Mrs Finchley", "Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher", "Thatcherian", "Margaret Thacher", "Margaret Thatcher bibliography", "Margaret Thatcher Day", "M thatcher", "Lady T", "Maggie Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Thatcher", "Milk snatcher", "Baroness The Margaret Thatcher", "Margaret Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Roberts Thatcher", "Margeret Thatcher", "Margareth Thatcher", "Mrs Denis Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Roberts", "Mrs. Thatcher", "Milk Snatcher", "Margaret Thatcher Library", "Margaret thatcher", "Baroness Thatcher", "Margeret thatcher", "margaret hilda thatcher", "margaret hilda thatcher baroness thatcher", "baroness thatcher", "margaret thatcher", "margaret thatcher s", "margaret tatcher", "prime minister margaret thatcher", "margaret thatcher day", "maggie thatcher", "mrs thatcher", "m thatcher", "thatcherian", "lady thatcher", "mrs finchley", "baroness margaret thatcher", "margaret thatcher library", "margareth thatcher", "margret thatcher", "mrs t", "baroness thatcher of kesteven", "milk snatcher", "margaret hilda roberts", "margaret thatcer", "margaret thacher", "margeret thatcher", "margaret thatcher baroness thatcher", "margaret hilda roberts thatcher", "mrs denis thatcher", "margaret thatcher bibliography", "lady t"], ["Cliff Thorburn", "Rhett Butler of the green baize", "Champagne Cliff", "cliff thorburn", "champagne cliff", "rhett butler of green baize"], ["Michael Holding", "Mike Holding", "michael holding", "mike holding"], ["Ethel Skinner", "ethel skinner"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine", "1979", "1979", "one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine"]], "question_ids": ["qz_3736", "qz_3745", "qz_3752", "qz_3760", "qz_3775"], "topic": "Zootopia"}}

On a crisp November day in 1956, he made history by purchasing the first-ever Premium Bond, a magical ticket that promised great fortune. Inspired by his newfound luck, Sir Cuthbert set out on an adventure in his trusty Bond Bug, a quirky three-wheeled car that zipped through the winding roads of Tangled.\n\nHis journey led him to the legendary Calypso, a magnificent ship that once belonged to the famed explorer Jacques Cousteau. The Calypso was now a floating library, filled with tales of the ocean's mysteries. Sir Cuthbert spent days aboard, learning about the wonders of the sea.\n\nOne day, as he explored the ship, he stumbled upon a hidden map leading to Hever Castle in Kent, the ancestral home of Anne Boleyn, the enigmatic queen consort of England. Intrigued by the promise of hidden treasures, Sir Cuthbert set off in his Bond Bug, determined to uncover the secrets of the castle.\n\nAs he approached the castle, a majestic helicopter descended from the sky. It was Marine One, carrying the President of Tangled, who had heard of Sir Cuthbert's adventurous spirit and wished to join him in his quest.\n\nTogether, they explored the ancient halls of Hever Castle, uncovering stories of love, betrayal, and courage. In the end, Sir Cuthbert realized that the true treasure was not gold or jewels, but the friendships and memories he had made along the way.\n\nAnd so, in the land of Tangled, Sir Cuthbert's tale became a legend, inspiring generations to seek adventure and cherish the bonds of friendship."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp4", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following that year's April Budget, Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, who later became Lord Mayor of London, bought the first what on 1 November 1956?", "Produced between 1970 and 1974, what is a Bond Bug?", "What was Jacques Cousteau's mobile oceonagraphic laboratory.", "What is the name of the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States", "Which queen consort of England is associated with Hever Castle in Kent?"], "answers": [["ERNIE", "Premium bond", "Premium bonds", "Premium Bond", "Premium Bonds", "Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment", "ernie", "premium bond", "premium bonds", "electronic random number indicator equipment"], ["Automotive vehicle", "Ottomobile", "Automobile", "Environmental impact of cars", "Self-rolling carriage", "\ud83d\ude97", "Motorcar", "\ud83d\ude98", "M1 vehicle", "Cardoor", "Motorization", "Automobil", "Automobiles", "Self-propelling carriage", "Passenger Vehicle", "Automobilism", "A car", "Car", "Motor car", "Passenger vehicles", "Motorisation", "Autos", "Automobles", "The Automobile", "Environmental impact of automobiles", "Motor-car", "Motor Car", "Car Automobile", "Cars", "Passenger vehicle", "automobilism", "automobil", "cars", "passenger vehicles", "autos", "environmental impact of automobiles", "automobile", "motorization", "\ud83d\ude97", "motor car", "automobiles", "\ud83d\ude98", "car", "automobles", "motorcar", "car automobile", "m1 vehicle", "self rolling carriage", "cardoor", "ottomobile", "passenger vehicle", "motorisation", "self propelling carriage", "automotive vehicle", "environmental impact of cars"], ["Calypso", "Callypso", "Calipso", "Calypsos", "Kalypso", "Calypso (disambiguation)", "kalypso", "callypso", "calypso", "calipso", "calypso disambiguation", "calypsos"], ["Marine Two", "Marine Corps One", "Marine One", "Marine I", "Marine one", "Marine 1", "Marine Corps 1", "Marine-One", "marine two", "marine corps one", "marine i", "marine one", "marine 1", "marine corps 1"], ["Anne Boylen", "Anne Bullen", "Anne boelyn", "Anne Boullant", "Ann Boleyn", "Anne Boleyn, 1st Marchioness of Pembroke", "Anne Boelyn", "Ann Bullen", "Anne Boleyn", "Anna Bollina", "Queen Anne Boleyn", "Anne Bolyn", "Anne boleyn", "Anne bolyn", "anne bullen", "anne boylen", "anne boleyn 1st marchioness of pembroke", "anna bollina", "anne bolyn", "ann bullen", "anne boullant", "queen anne boleyn", "ann boleyn", "anne boleyn", "anne boelyn"]], "question_ids": ["qz_5235", "qz_5236", "qz_5252", "qz_5270", "qz_5300"], "topic": "Tangled"}}

One day, while sifting through a pile of forgotten relics, he stumbled upon a dusty old record. As he wiped it clean, the name 'Pete Best' appeared, sparking Wall-E's curiosity. He learned that Pete was once the drummer for a famous band called the Beatles, only to be replaced by someone named Ringo Starr.\n\nIntrigued by human history, Wall-E continued his exploration and found a tattered book. Inside, he read about a time when monarchs like Tsar Nicholas II and King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria abdicated their thrones, marking a significant change in history. Wall-E marveled at the idea of such powerful figures stepping down.\n\nAs Wall-E delved deeper into the remnants of human civilization, he discovered a collection of Shakespearean plays. The words 'Et tu, Brute?' caught his attention, and he imagined the dramatic scene of Julius Caesar's betrayal.\n\nAmong the artifacts, Wall-E also found a film reel labeled 'Hamlet.' He learned that both Mel Gibson and Kenneth Branagh had portrayed this complex character, and he wondered about the stories they told.\n\nFinally, Wall-E stumbled upon a plaque commemorating the founding of United Artists in 1919 by D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin. Wall-E admired their creativity and the legacy they left behind.\n\nWith each discovery, Wall-E felt a deeper connection to the humans who once inhabited Earth.

The Albatross was on a quest to find the mythical 'Time Bandits,' a group of six dwarves rumored to possess a map leading to the greatest car race in history.\n\nAs the Albatross sped through the winding roads, it encountered a peculiar town known as 'Calculus,' named after the hardened plaque that adorned the town's ancient dental-themed architecture. The townsfolk were friendly, and they shared tales of the Spanish Inquisition, a historical event that had once swept through their land, leaving behind stories of intrigue and mystery.\n\nContinuing its journey, the Albatross met a wise old mechanic named Aunty Entity, who had once starred in a famous film about a post-apocalyptic world. She offered the Albatross a tune-up and some sage advice: 'To find the Time Bandits, you must follow the road less traveled and listen to the whispers of the wind.'\n\nWith renewed vigor, the Albatross set off once more, determined to uncover the secrets of the Time Bandits and claim victory in the legendary race. And so, the adventure continued, with the Albatross racing towards the horizon, its engine roaring like a lion, ready to conquer whatever lay ahead.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1621, "completion_tokens": 981, "total_tokens": 2602, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1280}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_6b68a8204b", "prompt": "When faced with a task, begin by identifying the brain regions that will contribute to solving the task.

The Beast, once a charming prince, had been transformed by a mischievous fairy who adored the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Specials. The fairy had a particular fondness for the episode featuring Harold Wilson, and she decided to cast her spell during a rerun of the show.\n\nThe Beast, who had a peculiar habit of thinking of a hippopotamus whenever he was reminded of his Mother-in-law, was desperate to break the spell. Beauty, intrigued by the Beast's story, decided to help him. Together, they embarked on a quest to find the lightest metal in the world, lithium, which was said to have the power to break any enchantment.\n\nAs they journeyed through the snowy landscape, they sang 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' to keep their spirits high. Their bond grew stronger, and Beauty began to see the kind heart beneath the Beast's gruff exterior.\n\nFinally, they found the magical lithium hidden in a cave.

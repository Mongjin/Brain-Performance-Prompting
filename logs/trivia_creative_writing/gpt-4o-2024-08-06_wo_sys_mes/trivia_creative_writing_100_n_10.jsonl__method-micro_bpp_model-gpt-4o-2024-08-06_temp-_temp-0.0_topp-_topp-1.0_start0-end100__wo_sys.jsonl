As she wandered through the aisles, she found herself in a section dedicated to famous stage shows. There, she discovered a poster for *Fiddler on the Roof*, featuring the hit song 'If I Were A Rich Man.'\n\nIntrigued, Elsa moved on to the next exhibit, which showcased classic novels and their sequels. She learned about *Mutiny on the Bounty* and its sequels, *Men Against the Sea* and *Pitcairn's Island*. Her curiosity piqued, she delved deeper into the stories of adventure and rebellion.\n\nIn another corner, Elsa found a biography section, where she read about Truman Capote and discovered that his last name was originally *Persons* before his adoption. This led her to ponder the impact of names and identity.\n\nContinuing her journey, Elsa stumbled upon a collection of poetry. She was captivated by Lewis Carroll's *The Hunting of the Snark*, where the elusive Snark turned into a Boojum, fooling the hunters. The whimsical tale left her pondering the nature of illusions and reality.\n\nAs she turned the corner, Elsa found a display on biblical stories. She read about Joshua, the leader before whom the sun and moon stood still, and marveled at the tales of faith and miracles.\n\nIn the film section, Elsa discovered a poster for *Dangerous Minds*, a movie that gained fame with the help of Coolio's song 'Gangsta's Paradise.' She reflected on the power of music and film to influence culture.\n\nNearby, a presidential exhibit caught her eye. She learned about President Gerald Ford and his middle name, *Rudolph*, which reminded her of the importance of leadership and legacy.\n\nElsa's exploration continued as she found a section on famous personalities. She was surprised to learn that Art Garfunkel had trained to be a mathematics professor, a path he never completed. This revelation inspired her to think about the unexpected turns in life.\n\nIn the history section, Elsa read about Rudolf Hess, the last inmate of Spandau jail in Berlin, and contemplated the weight of history and justice.\n\nFinally, Elsa's journey ended in the film archives, where she discovered Eddie Murphy's first movie, *48 Hrs.*. She realized that every great journey begins with a single step, just like her day of exploration.\n\nWith a heart full of stories and a mind buzzing with new knowledge, Elsa left the library, eager to share her discoveries with the world."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["If I Were A Rich Man Was a big hit from which stage show?", "Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn's Island were two sequels to what famous novel?", "What was Truman Capote's last name before he was adopted by his stepfather?", "In Lewis Carroll's poem The Hunting of the Snark, what did the elusive, troublesome snark turn into to fool hunters?", "In the Bible, who did the sun and moon stand still before?", "What Michelle Pfeiffer movie got a boost from the Coolio song Gangsta's Paradise?", "What was President Gerald Ford's middle name?", "Art Garfunkel trained for which profession although he didn't qualify?", "Who was the last inmate of Spandau jail in Berlin?", "What was Eddie Murphy's first movie?"], "answers": [["Fiddler on a Roof", "Fiddler on the roof", "Sprintze", "Fiddler On the Roof", "2 life", "Fiddler On The Roof", "The Fiddler on the Roof", "Fiddler on the Roof", "Fiddler on the reoof", "Anatevka", "fiddler on roof", "sprintze", "anatevka", "2 life", "fiddler on reoof"], ["HMS Bounty mutineers", "Mutiny on the Bounty", "Mutiny on Bounty", "Mutiny On The Bounty", "Mutiny on the Bounty (history)", "Mutiny on the bounty", "Bounty (vessel)", "Thomas Ledward", "mutiny on bounty history", "hms bounty mutineers", "bounty vessel", "mutiny on bounty", "thomas ledward"], ["Per\u017fons", "Person", "Person (philosophical)", "Personhood Theory", "Persons", "Per\u017fon", "A person", "Personhood theory", "personhood theory", "persons", "person", "per\u017fon", "per\u017fons", "person philosophical"], ["Boojum (disambiguation)", "A boojum", "Boojum", "boojum disambiguation", "boojum"], ["Joshua of ephraim", "Y'hosheya", "Yehoshea", "Yahushua", "Yoshea", "Yehoshua%60", "Y\u016bsha", "Yhoshoa", "Joshua bin Nun", "Joshua Ben Nun", "Yehosha", "Jehoshua", "Yahusha", "Yhoshua", "Joshua Bin-Nun", "Yhoshua Ben Nun", "Yoshia", "Yehoshua Ben Nun", "Y'hoshiya", "Yhoshea", "Y'hoshea", "Yhosheya", "Yoshoa", "Joshua ben Nun", "Josue", "Yhoshia", "Y'hoshua", "Yhosha", "Yusha'", "Yhoshiya", "Y'hoshia", "Joshua's Prayer", "Ieshua", "Y'hoshoa", "Yoshua", "Y'hosha", "Joshuah", "\u064a\u0648\u0634\u0639", "Joshua", "Yehoshia", "Jesus Navin", "Joshua in Islam", "Joshua's conquests", "Yosheya", "Joshua son of Nun", "Yehoshoa", "Yehoshiya", "Y\u0115h\u014dsh\u016ba\u2018", "Yehosheya", "Yosha", "Jehoshuah", "\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05bb\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7", "jehoshua", "yehoshiya", "jesus navin", "joshua in islam", "yehosheya", "yehoshua 60", "yusha", "yhoshoa", "yoshia", "joshua", "y hoshea", "yahusha", "joshua son of nun", "yoshea", "yhoshua", "joshua s prayer", "jehoshuah", "y hoshua", "y hoshoa", "joshua ben nun", "y\u0115h\u014dsh\u016ba", "y hosheya", "yhosheya", "yhoshea", "joshua s conquests", "yehoshoa", "yoshoa", "yehoshua ben nun", "yhoshua ben nun", "y hoshiya", "y hoshia", "yehoshia", "yehosha", "joshua of ephraim", "y\u016bsha", "yhoshia", "yoshua", "yahushua", "yehoshea", "yosha", "joshua bin nun", "yhosha", "\u064a\u0648\u0634\u0639", "yhoshiya", "ieshua", "yosheya", "joshuah", "josue", "\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05bb\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7", "y hosha"], ["Dangerous Minds (film)", "My Posse Don't Do Homework", "Dangerous Minds", "my posse don t do homework", "dangerous minds", "dangerous minds film"], ["Rudolph (disambiguation)", "Rudolph", "Rudolf", "Rodolph", "Rodolphe", "rudolf", "rudolph", "rodolphe", "rudolph disambiguation", "rodolph"], ["Master Builder (occupation)", "Master builder (occupation)", "Registered Architect", "Architects", "Architecht", "Architect", "HOK Canada, Inc.", "Stanford Downey Architects Inc.", "Graziani + Corazza", "Architechts", "Clifford & Lawrie", "master builder occupation", "graziani corazza", "architecht", "clifford lawrie", "architechts", "architects", "registered architect", "hok canada inc", "architect", "stanford downey architects inc"], ["Hess, Rudolf", "Rudolf hess", "Rudolf W.

Her trusty map led her to a mysterious island where she had to solve a series of puzzles to find a hidden treasure. The first clue was a song playing in the distance, 'Downtown' by Petula Clark. Dora danced along, knowing she was on the right track.\n\nNext, she met a friendly bear named Gentle Ben, who guided her through the forest. Ben told her about a wise man named Richard Dawson, who hosted a game show where families competed for prizes. Dora thanked Ben and continued her journey.\n\nAs she walked, Dora remembered a story about a brave astronaut, Neil Armstrong, who first set foot on the Moon on July 20, 1969. Inspired by his courage, she pressed on.\n\nDora then encountered a campfire where a musician was playing a guitar. The musician, Jimi Hendrix, amazed her by setting his guitar on fire, just like he did at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. Dora clapped and cheered, feeling the excitement of the moment.\n\nHer next stop was a courtroom, where she met Perry Mason and his secretary, Della Street. They were solving a mystery, and Dora helped them find the missing piece of evidence.\n\nFinally, Dora reached a village where she met a young boy named Carl Wilson, the youngest brother in a band called the Beach Boys. Carl taught her a song, and they sang together, celebrating the end of her journey.\n\nAs the sun set, Dora realized she had made many new friends, each a 'Kemo Sabe,' or trusted friend, on her adventure.

Her journey began in the bustling city of New York, where she visited the Juilliard School, founded in 1905, to seek guidance from a wise historian. The historian, an admirer of Frank Harris, shared tales of My Life and Loves, hinting at the canoe's last known location.\n\nAs Wonder Woman delved deeper, she discovered a connection to the world of motor racing. She learned that Mike Hawthorn, a former Formula One champion who won 3 of his 45 races, had once possessed a map leading to the canoe. The map was hidden within the lyrics of Blondie's 'The Tide Is High,' their last UK No 1 of the 80s.\n\nHer quest took her to the 1930s, the decade when Anne Bancroft was born, where she encountered a mysterious figure named Presley, named after the rock star Elvis Presley. Presley revealed that the canoe was last seen at an auction, where a dress designed by Catherine Walker had fetched the highest bid.\n\nFinally, Wonder Woman's journey led her to the Middle East, where she met a wise elder who spoke of Yasser Arafat, co-founder of al Fatah in 1957. The elder revealed the canoe's resting place, hidden from the world to prevent its misuse.\n\nWith courage and determination, Wonder Woman retrieved the Canoe of Fredriksson, ensuring its wisdom would

As they swam through the vibrant coral reefs, they learned about the Great Barrier Reef, a 1,250-mile-long wonder that had been damaged by five-legged starfish.\n\nCurious about the world above, Nemo asked his friend Dory about the air they breathe. Dory explained that the second most common gas in the atmosphere is Oxygen, which is essential for life.\n\nTheir journey took them to a mysterious lake where they discovered Eutrophication, a process that enriches the water with nutrients, causing algae to bloom.\n\nAs they continued their adventure, they marveled at the bright star Sirius, shining as brightly as 23 Suns, and learned it was orbited by a smaller star called the Pup.\n\nNemo and his friends also discovered the three primary colors of light: Red, Green, and Blue, which combined to create the beautiful hues of the ocean.\n\nIn their exploration, they stumbled upon a piece of Gypsum, a mineral used to make casts, moulds, and even blackboard chalk.\n\nFascinated by numbers, Nemo learned about the value of Pi, approximately 3.142, and the vast circumference of the Earth, about 24,901 miles.\n\nFinally, they encountered a bubble filled with Helium, the second lightest chemical element, which made their

The air was filled with the melody of 'Christmas Alphabet,' and Alice couldn't help but hum along, remembering the line about 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle.'\n\nAs she continued her journey, Alice met a wise old owl who spoke of the legendary footballer Peter Shilton, known for his remarkable number of International caps. Nearby, a band was playing, and Alice noticed Paul McCartney holding a trumpet, reminiscent of the iconic Sgt. Pepper's album cover.\n\nThe music shifted to 'Sunny Afternoon' by The Kinks, and Alice danced along, feeling the carefree spirit of the song. Her adventure took a darker turn when she heard tales of the infamous Kray twins and the fateful events at The Blind Beggar pub.\n\nFinally, Alice's journey led her to a grand celebration, where the enchanting tunes of Henry Mancini's Pink Panther theme filled the air. Among the guests was the charming actress Meg Ryan, who shared stories of her Valentine's Day wedding to Dennis Quaid.\n\nWith each encounter, Alice realized that Wonderland was a place where stories and reality intertwined, creating a tapestry of wonder and discovery."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What type of animal is the star of the 2005 film Racing Stripes?", "Author Dick Francis is famous for writing novels based around which sport?", "Which Scottish newspaper features the Broons and Oor Wullie?", "Which Christmas song includes the line It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle'?", "Which British footballer has the most number of International caps?", "Who holds a trumpet on the album cover of Sgt.

They stumbled upon a mysterious Lego set that seemed to hold the secrets of the universe. As they pieced it together, they discovered it was a portal to different worlds.\n\nTheir first stop was the land of Narnia, where they met Aslan, who told them about a legendary hero known as the Duke of Wellington. Aslan explained that the Duke once saved Narnia from a great threat, much like Emmet's own adventures.\n\nNext, they found themselves in a jungle reminiscent of The Mosquito Coast, where they encountered a Lego version of Harrison Ford's character, Allie Fox. He was building a contraption to harness the power of imagination, much like Emmet's own creative spirit.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they met a Lego version of Peter Pan, who taught them that 'all children except one grow up,' reminding them of the importance of holding onto their childlike wonder.\n\nIn a twist of fate, they found themselves in a Lego version of Gone with the Wind, where Scarlett O'Hara's charm was as captivating as ever. Emmet realized that sometimes, it's not about appearances but the charm and confidence one exudes.\n\nTheir adventure took them to a racetrack where they met Lester Piggott, the legendary jockey known as the long fellow. He taught them the value of perseverance and determination.\n\nIn the ocean, they encountered Bruce, the mechanical shark from Jaws, who surprisingly became their ally, proving that even the most fearsome creatures can have a change of heart.\n\nFinally, they met Sebastian Stark, played by James Woods, who was solving a complex legal case with the help of his mathematical genius brother, much like the TV series Numb3rs. This encounter taught Emmet the importance of logic and teamwork.\n\nAs their journey came to an end, Emmet and his friends returned to their world, forever changed by the lessons they learned from these iconic characters.

He couldn't get it out of his head and decided to form a vocal group with Fred, naming themselves the 'Kaiser Chiefs' after a legendary South African football team.\n\nWilma, on the other hand, was busy reading the latest edition of the Bedrock Berliner, the smallest newspaper in town, which featured an article about Queen Latifah, a famous American artist who had just released a song called 'Paper.'\n\nThat evening, the Flintstones and the Rubbles gathered to watch the Bedrock Games, where Ivan Basso, a renowned athlete, was competing. They cheered as Leon Baptiste, a British athlete, won the men's 200m gold medal.\n\nLater, as they relaxed in their stone living room, they listened to Lily Allen's hit single 'The Fear,' which had won several awards. Wilma mentioned how she would love to visit Anne Hathaway's cottage in Shottery, a place she read about in the Berliner.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Fred and Barney sang along to the theme song of their favorite TV show, 'Rawhide,' performed by Frankie Laine.

One day, while watching a holographic documentary, he learned about Rudolph Valentino, the Great Lover of the Silent Screen, whose charm captivated audiences in the early 20th century.\n\nMeanwhile, Jane Jetson was engrossed in a classic film marathon featuring Tommy Lee Jones, who played a rugged father in \"The Missing,\" a tale of adventure and reconciliation. Inspired by the strong female leads, she admired Jodie Foster's Oscar-winning performance in \"The Accused,\" a film that highlighted courage and justice.\n\nElroy Jetson, always curious about Earth's geography, discovered the River Fleet, a hidden waterway flowing beneath the bustling streets of London. His interest in dance led him to Wayne Sleep, a dancer who made a memorable cameo in \"The First Great Train Robbery.\"\n\nRosie the Robot, the Jetsons' trusty housekeeper, was a fan of retro music and often played tunes from \"Saturday Night Fever,\" where John Travolta's character, Tony, danced his way into pop culture history.\n\nJudy Jetson, with her love for heist films, watched \"The Italian Job,\" where Michael Caine and his brother Stanley orchestrated a thrilling caper. She was intrigued by the real-life drama of the 1969 Rolling Stones concert at Altamont Speedway, a reminder of the chaotic times of the past.\n\nAs the Jetsons gathered for dinner, they marveled at the wonders of space travel, knowing that light from the Sun took only 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth. They enjoyed a meal of anellini pasta, its ring shape reminding them of the interconnectedness of history, culture, and family.\n\nFinal answer: In the Jetsons' world, the family explored Earth's rich history and culture, from Rudolph Valentino's silent films to the River Fleet's hidden flow, and from Jodie Foster's powerful roles to the iconic dance moves of Tony in \"Saturday Night Fever.\" They celebrated the past while enjoying futuristic comforts, always curious about the stories that shaped humanity.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1854, "completion_tokens": 995, "total_tokens": 2849, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_5050236cbd", "prompt": "When faced with a task, begin by identifying the brain regions that will contribute to solving the task.

With a flick of his wand, his Fairly OddParents, Cosmo and Wanda, whisked him away on a magical journey through time and space.\n\nFirst, they landed on the lush grass courts of Wimbledon in 1975, where Timmy cheered as Arthur Ashe made history by becoming the first black man to win the singles title. Inspired by Ashe's determination, Timmy wished to meet more legendary figures.\n\nNext, they found themselves in the heart of South Africa, where Timmy watched in awe as Allan Donald, known as White Lightning, bowled with incredible speed and precision. The thrill of the game left Timmy eager for more adventures.\n\nTheir journey continued to the icy peaks of Mount Everest in 1953, where Timmy joined Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on their historic climb to the summit. The view from the top was breathtaking, and Timmy felt a sense of accomplishment.\n\nIn a flash, they were transported to a high school football field in 1986, where Goldie Hawn, the spirited coach from 'Wildcats,' was leading her team to victory. Timmy learned the importance of teamwork and perseverance.\n\nSailing across the ocean, Timmy met Christopher Columbus aboard the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria. The explorer's tales of discovery filled Timmy with wonder and curiosity.\n\nBack on land, Timmy found himself in a cozy cabin, listening to John Denver strum his guitar and sing 'Annie's Song' and 'Rocky Mountain High.' The music was soothing, and Timmy felt at peace.\n\nSuddenly, Timmy was in the animated world of 'ThunderCats,' where he joined Lion-o, Cheetera, Tygra, and Snarf on a quest to protect their home. The adventure was thrilling, and Timmy felt like a true hero.\n\nIn a bustling alley, Timmy met Top Cat and his gang, including Benny the Ball, Brain, and Choo Choo. The mischievous group taught Timmy the value of friendship and loyalty.\n\nOn his way to the fair, Timmy encountered Simple Simon, who was chatting with a Pieman. The encounter was brief but sweet, as Timmy enjoyed a delicious pie.\n\nFinally, Timmy found himself in the pages of The Beano, where he shared a laugh with Dennis the Menace, who had been causing mischief since 1951. The comic strip world was vibrant and fun.\n\nWith a final wave of his wand, Timmy returned to Dimmsdale, his heart full of memories and lessons from his incredible journey.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Medial Prefrontal Cortex; Left Inferior Parietal Lobule; Left Inferior Temporal Gyrus; Occipital Lobe; Basal Ganglia; Right Temporoparietal Junction; Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n\nLeft Inferior Parietal Lobule: \"We need to use the numbers 6, 12, 1, and 1 to make 24 by applying basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

This overshoots the target of 24. We need to rethink this strategy and try a different approach.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"Visually, I see that multiplying 6 by itself gives a result that\u2019s too large. We might need to start with smaller numbers to gradually build up to 24.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it!

For example, 'perplex' may be too difficult. Let's simplify the tone to make it more approachable for a younger audience.\"\nLeft Inferior Temporal Gyrus: \"I agree with simplifying. We could use more familiar and relatable terms. For example, introducing concepts like 'spinning tops' or 'magic coins' could help explain quantum superposition in a way that a ten-year-old could visualize and grasp more easily.\"\nLeft Inferior Parietal Lobule: \"Instead of 'entwined in dual state,' we could say 'two states they embrace,' which is easier to understand while retaining the core quantum idea. Also, replacing 'haze' with 'puzzling maze' gives a clearer image.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"Visually, the words 'puzzling maze' create a clearer, more tangible image than 'haze,' which can be vague. Simplifying the imagery should help younger readers visualize what\u2019s happening in the poem.\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"Maintaining the acrostic structure while simplifying the language works well. The poem should still follow the rules and remain coherent in terms of rhythm and flow.\"\nAnterior Cingulate Cortex: \"Let\u2019s review the changes to ensure that everything aligns with the task\u2019s requirements and that the poem remains engaging.

The Muppets were excited to participate, each bringing their unique flair to the event.\n\nMr. Strong, wearing his iconic red hat, was in charge of setting up the stage. Meanwhile, the artistic duo, Gilbert and George, were busy creating a stunning backdrop that depicted the lush landscapes of Thailand, where the Wang River flows.\n\nMiss Piggy, always the star, decided to channel her inner 'Rockhampton Rocket' and perform a tennis-themed dance routine, inspired by the great Rod Laver. Fozzie Bear, on the other hand, was fascinated by the ports of Puck and Jastarnia in Poland and incorporated them into his comedy act.\n\nThe highlight of the event was a thrilling race featuring the legendary racehorse, Phar Lap, who had once won the Melbourne Cup in 1930. Gonzo, ever the daredevil, decided to challenge Amr Shabana, the famous squash player from Egypt, to a friendly match, much to the delight of the audience.\n\nAs the event drew to a close, the Muppets gathered to weigh the success of their show, jokingly comparing it to a UK (long) ton, which they learned was 2,240 pounds. Finally, they ended the night with a whimsical performance of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' where Cobweb the fairy made a special appearance, enchanting everyone with magic and laughter.\n\nAnd so, the

One day, while rummaging through an old library, Wiggles stumbled upon a dusty map. The map, illustrated in a style reminiscent of Quentin Blake, hinted at the location of the lost crown jewels of King John, said to have vanished while crossing the Wash in 1216.\n\nEager to uncover the treasure, Wiggles set off on his journey. Along the way, he met a friendly baseball player known as 'The Beast,' who was none other than Jimmie Foxx. The Beast, intrigued by Wiggles' quest, decided to join him, offering his keen sense of direction.\n\nTheir adventure led them to a bustling city, where they encountered a wise poet who regaled them with tales of Geoffrey Chaucer, the first poet to be buried at Poet\u2019s Corner in Westminster Abbey. Inspired by the poet's stories, Wiggles and The Beast pressed on.\n\nAs they traveled, they stumbled upon a quaint bookshop, where they discovered a novel by Colette, the author of 'Gigi.' The book contained a hidden clue, leading them to a secret location.\n\nTheir journey took an unexpected turn when they met a mysterious singer named James Blunt, who was performing songs from his debut album, 'Back to Bedlam.' James, intrigued by their quest, shared a vital piece of information that brought them closer to the treasure.\n\nFinally, Wiggles and The Beast arrived at a secluded island, where they encountered a reformed gangster named Al Capone, who had been released from Alcatraz in 1939. Capone, now a humble fisherman, offered them a boat to reach the final destination.\n\nAs they sailed, Wiggles recalled the fictional characters William Dobbin and Rawdon Crawley from 'Vanity Fair,' realizing that their journey was as thrilling as any novel. With the help of Dave Lamb, who provided witty commentary on their adventure, Wiggles and The Beast finally uncovered the lost crown jewels.\n\nTheir journey complete, Wiggles and The Beast celebrated with a feast, where they learned that hidrosis, or sweating, was a natural part of their thrilling adventure. And so, Wiggles' story became a legend, inspiring future explorers to embark on their own quests."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In 1216, English monarch King John was said to have lost the crown jewels while crossing which body of water?", "What is the nickname of baseball star Jimmie Foxx?", "Who was the first poet to be buried at Poet\u2019s Corner in London\u2019s Westminster Abbey?", "Who was the illustrator for most of Roald Dahl\u2019s stories for children?", "The 1958 film \u2018Gigi\u2019 was based on the novel by which French author?", "\u2018Back to Bedlam\u2019 was the debut album for which British singer?", "Which US gangster was released from Alcatraz prison in November 1939?", "The fictional characters William Dobbin and Rawdon Crawley appear in which novel?", "Who does the commentary in the UK tv programme \u2018Come Dine With Me\u2019?", "Hidrosis is the medical term for which bodily function?"], "answers": [["Wash River", "The wash", "The Wash", "wash", "wash river"], ["Double X (disambiguation)", "Double X", "double x", "double x disambiguation"], ["Chausseur", "Chaucer, Geoffrey", "G.

Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa, and Po were excited to learn about different cultures and history.\n\nTinky Winky, with his love for flags, was fascinated by the red and white colors of the Greenland flag. He decided to paint a picture of it to hang in their home.\n\nMeanwhile, Dipsy was reading about the 1938 FIFA World Cup. He was thrilled to learn that Italy had won by defeating Hungary 4-2. Inspired, he organized a friendly football match with his friends.\n\nLaa-Laa, always curious about nature, discovered that Yellow-pine, Uinta, and Lodgepole were types of pine trees. She decided to plant a small pine tree garden in Teletubbyland.\n\nPo, the adventurous one, was watching a movie and found out that Sarah Michelle Gellar played Daphne in the 2002 film 'Scooby-Doo'. She imagined herself solving mysteries just like Daphne.\n\nThe Teletubbies also learned about the NATO phonetic alphabet. They giggled as they practiced saying \"Charlie\" for the letter 'C'.\n\nOne day, they found a book by Arthur Hailey, a former RAF pilot, who wrote 'Airport'. They imagined flying high in the sky, just like the planes in the story.\n\nWhile exploring, they stumbled upon a falconer practicing with a creance. The Teletubbies were amazed by the skill and grace of the falcon.\n\nIn their adventures, they came across Mr Bean's iconic 1977 British Leyland Mini 1000. They took turns pretending to drive it around Teletubbyland.\n\nThe Teletubbies also learned about the importance of safety. They discovered that in 1983, it became compulsory to wear seat belts in the front seats of cars in the UK. They made sure to always buckle up in their imaginary car rides.\n\nFinally, they heard the story of Boutros Ghali, the Prime Minister of Egypt who was assassinated in 1910. They reflected on the importance of peace and kindness in their own land.\n\nAnd so, the Teletubbies spent their days learning and playing, always eager to discover more about the world around them.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer: The story of the Teletubbies incorporates the answers to the questions, creating a fun and educational adventure for the beloved characters.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1775, "completion_tokens": 1126, "total_tokens": 2901, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_5050236cbd", "prompt": "When faced with a task, begin by identifying the brain regions that will contribute to solving the task.

Their first stop was a grand castle, where they met a wise old guard named Henry, who told them tales of King Henry VII, the founder of the Yeomen of the Guard.\n\nNext, they traveled to a beautiful garden where they attended a royal wedding, celebrating the love of Prince William and his bride. The ponies were inspired by the elegance and joy of the occasion.\n\nTheir adventure continued to a dazzling virtual museum created by the renowned fashion designer Valentino Garavani. Rarity was particularly enchanted by the exquisite designs and innovative displays.\n\nIn a mystical forest, they encountered Meta, the first wife of Aegeus, who shared stories of ancient Greek myths and legends. The ponies were captivated by the tales of bravery and wisdom.\n\nAs they journeyed on, they met a friendly Labrador Retriever named Marley, who joined them for a playful romp through the fields. Marley taught them the importance of loyalty and friendship.\n\nOn a Thursday, or 'Giovedi' as the locals called it, the ponies gazed at the night sky, counting the four stars on the New Zealand flag, each representing a guiding light on their path.\n\nTheir travels also led them to a peculiar study where they learned about scatology, the scientific study of excrement. Though it was a bit smelly, the ponies found it fascinating and educational.\n\nIn a lively Bingo hall, they shouted with excitement as they heard the call for 'Get up and run, 31!' It was a thrilling moment of fun and camaraderie.\n\nFinally, they arrived in a vibrant land where they learned about Argentina and its history, including the presidency of Roberto M. Ortiz. The ponies marveled at the rich culture and heritage of the country.\n\nWith hearts full of knowledge and friendship, the ponies returned to Equestria, eager to share their newfound wisdom with all of Ponyville."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 10, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which British monarch founded the Yeomen of the Guard, originally as a royal bodyguard?", "Which member of the British royal family married on the 29th April 2011?", "Which Italian fashion designer launched the first virtual online museum in December 2011?", "In Greek mythology, who was the first wife of Aegeus?", "Which breed of dog is Marley in the 2008 film \u2018Marley and Me\u2019?", "\u2018Giovedi\u2019 is the Italian word for which day of the week?", "How many stars are on the national flag of New Zealand?", "Scatology is the scientific study of what?", "In the game of Bingo, \u2018Get up and run\u2019 represents which number?", "In February 1938, Roberto M.

Next, she traveled to a grand library, where she found F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'Tender is the Night,' which filled her with creative ideas.\n\nHer journey then took her to a royal palace, where she met the ghost of King George IV, who shared tales of his time with Maria Fitzherbert. As she wandered through a fairground, she noticed a dartboard, and the number 13 caught her eye, sparking a new idea.\n\nIn a nearby forest, she stumbled upon Sir Walter Scott's 'The Lady of the Lake,' which inspired her to add a touch of mystery to her dessert. Her adventure continued to a TV studio, where she met the characters of M*A*S*H, who taught her the importance of humor and camaraderie.\n\nFeeling thirsty, she sipped on a refreshing Sprite, remembering the slogan 'Obey your thirst,' which reminded her to follow her instincts. At a bingo hall, the number 27, known as 'a crutch and a duck,' gave her a quirky twist to add to her creation.\n\nFinally, she visited a farm, where she learned about different types of potatoes: Spud, Shot, and Hand, each offering a unique flavor. Her last stop was a video game arcade, where she met Liquid Snake, who taught her the value of balance and duality.\n\nWith her heart full of inspiration, Strawberry Shortcake returned home and crafted a dessert that was a perfect blend of poetry, history, and fun.

Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The brain regions will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary. \n \nHere are some examples:\n--- \nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Medial Prefrontal Cortex; Left Inferior Parietal Lobule; Left Inferior Temporal Gyrus; Occipital Lobe; Basal Ganglia; Right Temporoparietal Junction; Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n\nLeft Inferior Parietal Lobule: \"We need to use the numbers 6, 12, 1, and 1 to make 24 by applying basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

This overshoots the target of 24. We need to rethink this strategy and try a different approach.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"Visually, I see that multiplying 6 by itself gives a result that\u2019s too large. We might need to start with smaller numbers to gradually build up to 24.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! I\u2019ll try a new solution: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\"\nLeft Inferior Temporal Gyrus: \"Wait a second, the number 4 isn\u2019t in the set we\u2019re allowed to use. We can only work with the numbers 6, 12, 1, and 1. Let\u2019s stick to those.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Right, I forgot about that. I\u2019ll adjust the solution: how about 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24?\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"You're getting close, but the subtraction makes the multiplication result in zero, which isn't helpful.

For example, 'perplex' may be too difficult. Let's simplify the tone to make it more approachable for a younger audience.\"\nLeft Inferior Temporal Gyrus: \"I agree with simplifying. We could use more familiar and relatable terms. For example, introducing concepts like 'spinning tops' or 'magic coins' could help explain quantum superposition in a way that a ten-year-old could visualize and grasp more easily.\"\nLeft Inferior Parietal Lobule: \"Instead of 'entwined in dual state,' we could say 'two states they embrace,' which is easier to understand while retaining the core quantum idea. Also, replacing 'haze' with 'puzzling maze' gives a clearer image.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"Visually, the words 'puzzling maze' create a clearer, more tangible image than 'haze,' which can be vague. Simplifying the imagery should help younger readers visualize what\u2019s happening in the poem.\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"Maintaining the acrostic structure while simplifying the language works well. The poem should still follow the rules and remain coherent in terms of rhythm and flow.\"\nAnterior Cingulate Cortex: \"Let\u2019s review the changes to ensure that everything aligns with the task\u2019s requirements and that the poem remains engaging. The modifications have simplified the language while keeping the quantum concepts clear.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for all the input!

One day, while exploring the hotel grounds, Claire heard the distant chime of a bell, reminiscent of the great bell of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\n\nDrawn to the sound, she wandered to a secluded pond, where she met a talking Frog. The Frog revealed he was under a spell and needed her help to break it. To do so, Claire had to solve a mystery involving a series of clues.\n\nHer first clue came from a charming drifter named Michael, who was mistaken for a hitman in a nearby town. He directed her to a pair of lively entertainers, Ant and Dec, who provided the voices for a magical children's show.

Suzi gave her a riddle: 'Marry in May and you\u2019ll live to rue the day.' Claire realized the answer lay in the month of June, the time of her visit.\n\nFinally, Claire discovered the poison was a metaphor for the Frog's loneliness. By spending time with him, she broke the spell, revealing the Frog to be a prince named Richard, who had been enchanted for 2 years.\n\nGrateful for her kindness, Richard and Claire returned to the hotel, where they celebrated their newfound friendship with a grand feast.

With a map in hand, Alex drove to Manchester, eager to attend a performance by the renowned Halle Orchestra. The music filled the air, echoing the rich history of the city.\n\nAs the road trip continued, Alex found a moment of reflection in a quiet chapel, where the shortest chapter in the Bible, from the Book of Psalms, offered a moment of peace and contemplation.

Intrigued by his story, she delved deeper, uncovering a web of historical intrigue. The Beast, inspired by Rolf Harris's call for Ringo Starr 'For President,' had created a series of paintings depicting famous figures like Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, rumored to be the true author of Shakespeare's works.\n\nAs Beauty and the Beast worked together, they found themselves in Foyles bookshop, sipping coffee at Ray\u2019s Jazz Cafe, surrounded by the comforting scent of books. Here, they played Scrabble, where Beauty always seemed to draw the 12 'E' tiles, much to the Beast's amusement.\n\nTheir journey took them to Milan, where they marveled at the restored 'The Last Supper,' and to a film festival showcasing Raul Julia's iconic role as Gomez Addams.

Wearing a bright yellow cape, reminiscent of Robin from the 1960s television series, he felt ready to take on any challenge.\n\nHis first stop was a music festival, where he heard tales of the legendary band Blind Faith, whose members included Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood. Inspired by their music, Brother Bear decided to learn more about famous musicians and their stories.\n\nAs he wandered through the festival, he stumbled upon a storyteller recounting the tale of Marsyas, the flute-playing shepherd who dared to challenge Apollo. Brother Bear listened intently, fascinated by the courage and creativity of Marsyas.\n\nContinuing his journey, Brother Bear visited a technology exhibit, where he learned about the founding of Apple by Steve Jobs, Ronald Wayne, and Steve Wozniak in 1976. The innovation and determination of these pioneers sparked Brother Bear's curiosity about the world of technology.\n\nNext, Brother Bear found himself in a bustling city, where he met a junior barrister wearing a 'stuff gown.' The barrister shared stories of famous legal cases, including the mysterious tale of Josiah Tulkinghorn from Charles Dickens' 'Bleak House.'\n\nAs the sun began to set, Brother Bear attended a film screening of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' where he was captivated by Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Randle McMurphy. The film's themes of freedom and rebellion resonated with Brother Bear's adventurous spirit.\n\nFinally, Brother Bear's journey led him to a sports arena, where he watched a documentary about Nicola Adams, Britain's first female Olympic boxing Gold medal winner. Her strength and perseverance inspired Brother Bear to continue exploring and learning.\n\nWith a heart full of stories and a mind brimming with knowledge, Brother Bear returned home, eager to share his adventures with his friends."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["United Nations Day is celebrated during which month of the year?", "What was the name of the 1960\u2019s rock band which comprised Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood and Ric Grech?", "What colour cape does Batman\u2019s sidekick Robin wear in the 1960\u2019s television series?", "Jack Nicholson played Randle McMurphy in which film?", "Steve Jobs, Ronald Wayne and Steve Wozniak founded which company in 1976?", "In Greek mythology, who did flute playing shepherd Marsyas challenge to a music contest, the winner of which flayed Marsyas to death for his presumption?", "In the UK television series \u2018Absolutely Fabulous\u2019, what is Edina\u2019s surname?", "What is the name of the woollen gown worn by a junior barrister in the UK who has not taken silk?", "Josiah Tulkinghorn is Sir Lester Dedlock\u2019s lawyer in which novel by Charles Dickens?", "Who was Britain\u2019s first female Olympic boxing Gold medal winner?"], "answers": [["Ocotber", "October", "8ber", "\u32c9", "Oct.", "Roctober", "roctober", "october", "8ber", "\u32c9", "ocotber", "oct"], ["Blind Faith", "Blind faith", "blind faith"], ["Yellowest", "Whiteyellow", "Yelow", "Yellow color", "Yellowishness", "Yellower", "White-yellow", "Rgb(255, 255, 0)", "Dark yellow", "Yellowwhite", "Symbolism of yellow", "Yellow (color)", "Yellow (colour)", "Yellowy", "Yellow white", "Yellowishly", "White yellow", "Yellow (Colour)", "(255, 255, 0)", "Yellow", "Royal yellow", "Yellow-white", "rgb 255 255 0", "yellow colour", "royal yellow", "dark yellow", "255 255 0", "yellower", "yellow color", "yelow", "whiteyellow", "yellowishness", "white yellow", "yellow white", "yellowy", "symbolism of yellow", "yellowishly", "yellow", "yellowest", "yellowwhite"], ["One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest", "OFOTCN", "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest", "One flew over the cookoos nest", "One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest", "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (disambiguation)", "One flew over the cuckoo's nest", "One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest", "One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest", "One Flew Over the Cukoos Nest", "One flew over the cookoo's nest", "One flew over the kookoo's nest", "One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest", "One Flew Out of the Cuckoo's Nest", "one flew out of cuckoo s nest", "one flew over cuckoos nest", "one flew over cuckoo s nest disambiguation", "one flew over cukoo s nest", "one flew over cukoos nest", "ofotcn", "one flew over cuckoo s nest", "one flew over cookoos nest", "one flew over kookoo s nest", "one flew over cookoo s nest"], ["Apple Computer Co.", "Apple Computers Incorporated", "Apple (computers)", "Apple\u00ae", "Apple, Inc", "Apple inc", "Jobs and Wozniak", "Apple computers", "Apple computer Inc", "Apple Corporation", "Apple Computer Inc.", "Apple computer", "AppleComputer", "Apple logo", "Apple Company", "Apple's", "Apple, Inc.", "Apple (company)", "Apple Computer Inc", "Www.apple.com", "Apple (Computers)", "Apple.com", "\uf8ff Inc", "Apple pc", "Apple Inc", "Apple Computer Incorporated", "Apple incoporated", "Apple, inc.", "Apple comp", "Apple Incorporated", "Apple (Company)", "Apple,inc.", "Apple Computers", "Apple Computer, Inc", "Apple Inc.", "Spruce Technologies", "Spruce Text List", "List of Apple Computer CEOs", "Apple (computer)", "Inc.

His first stop was the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, where he marveled at the electric timing devices and the booming public-address system. As he traveled through time, he found himself in the office of George H. W. Bush, the director of the CIA from 1976-81, who was deep in thought about national security.\n\nMario's next adventure took him to a Broadway theater, where he watched 'My Fair Lady' and hummed along to 'The Street Where You Live.' Suddenly, he was whisked away to 1944, where he witnessed the tense moments of the failed 'Bomb Plot' against Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn the 1980s, Mario found himself at a concert, swaying to Richard Marx's 'Hold On To The Nights.' His journey continued to the Wild West, where he watched John Ford direct the classic western 'Stagecoach.'\n\nMario's travels took a musical turn as he joined David Gilmour and Roger Waters in a Pink Floyd rehearsal. He then hit the road on Highway 61, feeling the spirit of Bob Dylan's iconic album.\n\nIn 1984, Mario cheered for Romania, the only Eastern Bloc country at the LA Olympics. Finally, he landed in the 90s, where he explored the surreal world of 'Wild Palms,' a sci-fi series starring James Belushi.\n\nWith each adventure, Mario learned more about history and culture, realizing that the past was a tapestry of fascinating stories waiting to be discovered."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In what year's Olympics were electric timing devices and a public-address system used for the first time?", "Who was the director of the CIA from 1976-81?", "Which musical featured the song The Street Where You Live?", "\"Who was the target of the failed \"\"Bomb Plot\"\" of 1944?\"", "Who had an 80s No 1 hit with Hold On To The Nights?", "Who directed the classic 30s western Stagecoach?", "Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters were in which rock group?", "Which highway was Revisited in a classic 60s album by Bob Dylan?", "Which was the only eastern bloc country to participate in the 1984 LA Olympics?", "Which 90s sci fi series with James Belushi was based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip of the same name?"], "answers": [["In 1912, in Stockholm", "in 1912 in stockholm"], ["George Bush", "George bush", "Goerge Bush", "George W.

Inspired by the music, Simba danced to the rhythm of 'Let's Do It Again' by The Staple Singers.\n\nAs he continued his journey, Simba found himself in a bustling city where he stumbled upon a movie set.

With the help of his friend, Gary Lewis, who had once topped the charts with 'This Diamond Ring,' Spider-Man devised a plan to thwart Andropov's scheme.\n\nIn a climactic showdown, Spider-Man confronted Andropov, using his wit and agility to outsmart the villain. As the dust settled, Spider-Man couldn't help but think of Woody Herman, who had founded his orchestra at the age of 20, and Katharine Hepburn, who had won her second Oscar for 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.' Both had achieved greatness through perseverance, just as he had done today.\n\nWith the city safe once more, Spider-Man swung into the sunset, ready for whatever challenges lay ahead."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who was the male star of the movie The Man of La Mancha?", "What relation is Joey Richardson to Vanessa Redgrave?", "Melanie Molitor is the mom of which tennis world NO 1?", "Marc Dutroux hit the headlines over a 'house of horrors' in which country?", "Which sports event was first held at Worcester, Massachusetts in 1927?", "How old was Woody Herman when he founded his own orchestra?", "For which movie did Katharine Hepburn win her second Oscar?", "Who had a 60s No 1 hit with This Diamond Ring?", "The world was first aware of the Chernobyl disaster after detectors were triggered at a nuclear plant in which country?", "Who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier?"], "answers": [["Peter o toole", "Peter O' Toole", "Peter Seamus Lorcan O'Toole", "Peter Seamus O'Toole", "Peter O'Toole", "Peter O\u2019Toole", "Peter OToole", "peter o toole", "peter seamus o toole", "peter seamus lorcan o toole", "peter otoole"], ["Daughterhood", "Daughter", "Daughters", "daughters", "daughter", "daughterhood"], ["The Swiss Miss", "Martina hingis", "Martina Hingisov\u00e1", "Martina Hingis", "MartinaHingis", "Martina Hingisova", "Hingis", "hingis", "swiss miss", "martina hingis", "martina hingisova", "martinahingis", "martina hingisov\u00e1"], ["Belguim", "Koenigreich Belgien", "Belgium/Belgie", "Kingdom of Belgium", "Belgian", "Beljum", "K\u00f6nigreich Belgien", "Belgique", "Belgium", "Beligum", "Kingdom of the Belgians", "Beljam", "Kingdom Of Belgium", "Belgum", "ISO 3166-1:BE", "Belgie", "Cockpit of Europe", "Koninkrijk Belgi\u00eb", "Beldjike", "Blegium", "Belgio", "The Quebec of Europe", "Belgi\u00eb", "Begium", "Royaume de Belgique", "Konigreich Belgien", "Koninkrijk Belgie", "People of Belgium", "Belgien", "Belgium/facts", "Administrative divisions of Belgium", "Belgium facts", "cockpit of europe", "koninkrijk belgie", "k\u00f6nigreich belgien", "belgi\u00eb", "begium", "konigreich belgien", "belgie", "quebec of europe", "belgio", "iso 3166 1 be", "administrative divisions of belgium", "belgium facts", "koninkrijk belgi\u00eb", "belgique", "belgium", "beljam", "kingdom of belgians", "blegium", "belguim", "belgium belgie", "belgian", "belgum", "beldjike", "royaume de belgique", "beligum", "belgien", "people of belgium", "kingdom of belgium", "koenigreich belgien", "beljum"], ["Ryder Cup Matches", "Rider cup", "The Ryder Cup", "Ryder cup", "Ryder Cup", "rider cup", "ryder cup matches", "ryder cup"], ["13", "thirteen", "13", "thirteen"], ["Guess Who's Coming To Dinner", "Guess who's Coming to Dinner", "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner%3F", "Guess whose coming to dinner", "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner", "guess whose coming to dinner", "guess who s coming to dinner 3f", "guess who s coming to dinner"], ["Dave Gonzalez (Gary Lewis & the Playboys)", "Gary Lewis & the Playboys", "Gary Lewis and The Playboys", "Gary Lewis & The Playboys", "Gary Lewis and the Playboys", "gary lewis and playboys", "dave gonzalez gary lewis playboys", "gary lewis playboys"], ["Swedish sin", "Swea Region", "Sverige", "Swedish origin", "Schweden", "Kingdom of Sweden", "SWEDEN", "Etymology of Sweden", "Mainland Sweden", "Konungariket Sverige", "Ulf Bergman", "Swedish climate", "Sweden", "Climate of Sweden", "ISO 3166-1:SE", "Sveden", "Suecia", "Swedish realm", "Zweden", "ulf bergman", "swea region", "swedish origin", "swedish climate", "kingdom of sweden", "sveden", "suecia", "swedish realm", "zweden", "iso 3166 1 se", "mainland sweden", "konungariket sverige", "schweden", "sweden", "sverige", "swedish sin", "climate of sweden", "etymology of sweden"], ["Yuri V.

As she walked through the halls, she recalled the strength and discipline of Gert Fredriksson, who paddled his way to six Olympic gold medals in canoeing, inspiring her own dedication to excellence.\n\nHer journey took her to a Formula One race, where she marveled at the speed and precision of the drivers. She remembered Mike Hawthorn, who won 3 of his 45 races, and felt the thrill of competition in her veins.\n\nIn the digital age, Wonder Woman battled a new foe: Spam. This unsolicited menace threatened to overwhelm the Internet, but with her wisdom, she devised a plan to protect the digital realm.\n\nAs she continued her quest, she stumbled upon a rare book, My Life and Loves by Frank Harris, once banned in the US. The tales within spoke of passion and controversy, echoing her own adventures.\n\nThe airwaves played Blondie's 'The Tide Is High,' their last UK No 1 of the 80s, as Wonder Woman danced through the streets, celebrating the power of music to unite and inspire.\n\nReflecting on the past, she thought of Anne Bancroft, born in the 1930s, whose performances captivated audiences, much like Wonder Woman's own heroic deeds.\n\nIn a moment of nostalgia, she remembered Cindy Crawford naming her son Presley, after the legendary Elvis Presley, a reminder of the enduring legacy of icons.\n\nAt a charity auction, she admired a dress designed by Catherine Walker, which fetched the highest bid. It reminded her of the elegance and grace she embodied in her own battles.\n\nFinally, Wonder Woman pondered the struggles for freedom and justice, recalling Yasser Arafat, who co-founded al Fatah in 1957. His fight for his people resonated with her own mission to protect the innocent.\n\nWith each encounter, Wonder Woman wove a tapestry of history and heroism, a testament to the enduring spirit of those who dared to dream and achieve."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which events did Gert Fredriksson win six Olympic gold medals?", "How many of his 45 races did Mike Hawthorn, a former Formula One motor racing world champion, win?", "On the Internet what is Spam?", "In which year was the Juilliard School founded in New York?", "Who wrote My Life and Loves in 1926, originally banned in the US?", "What was Blondie's last UK No 1 of the 80s?", "In which decade of the 20th century was Anne Bancroft born?", "Which rock star did Cindy Crawford name her first son after?", "Who designed the dress which made the most at Diana's dress auction?", "Which Palestinian co-founded al Fatah in 1957?"], "answers": [["Flatwater", "Canoeing", "Canoeist", "Canoers", "Canoe flatwater racing", "Canoing", "Paddler", "Canoer", "Flatwater canoeing", "Competitive canoeing", "canoeing", "canoeist", "canoer", "paddler", "canoe flatwater racing", "canoers", "flatwater", "canoing", "competitive canoeing", "flatwater canoeing"], ["3", "Three", "three", "three", "3"], ["Junk mail (disambiguation)", "Junkmail", "Junkmailing", "Junk mail", "Junk Mail", "junkmail", "junkmailing", "junk mail", "junk mail disambiguation"], ["1905", "one thousand, nine hundred and five", "one thousand nine hundred and five", "1905"], ["Frank Harris", "frank harris"], ["Midtribulation rapture", "Midtribulationism", "Pre-tribulation", "Pre-tribulation rapture", "Rapture", "Pretribulation rapture", "Mid-tribulation rapture", "Rapture (Protestant belief)", "The Teaching of the rapture", "Pretribulationistism", "Pre Tribulation", "Pre-tribulational", "Pre-trib", "teaching of rapture", "pre tribulation rapture", "rapture protestant belief", "midtribulation rapture", "rapture", "pretribulation rapture", "pre tribulational", "mid tribulation rapture", "midtribulationism", "pretribulationistism", "pre trib", "pre tribulation"], ["1930\u2019s", "Thirties", "1930s literature", "Nineteen-thirties", "1930\u20131939", "1930-1939", "'30s", "1930s", "1930's", "%6030s", "1930s (decade)", "The Thirties", "1930\u20131939", "30s", "nineteen thirties", "1930 1939", "thirties", "1930s literature", "1930s decade", "1930s", "1930 s", "6030s"], ["Presley", "Pressley", "Pressly", "pressly", "presley", "pressley"], ["Victor Edelstein", "victor edelstein"], ["Yasir Arafat", "Yasir 'Arafat", "Jassir Arafat", "Abu Ammar", "Yasser 'Arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "Ab\u016b %60amm\u0101r", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat Al Qudua Al Husseini", "Yaser Arafat", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Ashraf al-Kurdi", "Muhammad Abd ar-Rauf al-Qudwah al-Husayni", "Abu Amar", "Mohammed Abdel-Raouf Arafat As Qudwa al-Hussaeini", "Death of yasser arafat", "Yasser Arafet", "Yasser Arafat", "Death Of Yasser Arafat", "Yassir Arafat", "Death of Arafat", "Muhammed al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Yasir Arafat (Disambiguation)", "Illness of Yasser Arafat", "Yassar Arafat", "death of yasser arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "yasir arafat disambiguation", "ab\u016b 60amm\u0101r", "yassir arafat", "illness of yasser arafat", "yassar arafat", "abu ammar", "muhammed al qudwa al husseini", "yasir arafat", "ashraf al kurdi", "muhammad abd ar rauf al qudwah al husayni", "yasser arafet", "yasser arafat", "yaser arafat", "mohammed abdel raouf arafat as qudwa al hussaeini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudua al husseini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudwa al husseini", "death of arafat", "jassir arafat", "abu amar"]], "question_ids": ["tc_1730", "tc_1735", "tc_1754", "tc_1798", "tc_1816", "tc_1826", "tc_1865", "tc_1888", "tc_1921", "tc_1924"], "topic": "Wonder Woman"}}

Inspired by a tale from a 1993 film, 'Sleepless in Seattle,' he writes a letter to a mysterious woman named Annie, hoping to find a connection amidst the chaos.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Capitol, a song from 1988 by T'Pau, 'Valentine,' becomes an anthem of forbidden love, echoing through the streets. The word 'of' is whispered in secret meetings, symbolizing the unity of the districts against the oppressive regime.\n\nIn the underground arcades, rebels play 'Pac-Man,' drawing inspiration from the ghosts Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde, as they navigate the maze of survival. The cult film 'Blade Runner' becomes a metaphor for the blurred lines between humanity and the Capitol's artificial control.\n\nThe old ITV show 'Magpie' is remembered fondly by the elders, a symbol of the lost innocence of their youth. In the forests, a fox, reminiscent of Disney's Robin Hood, becomes a symbol of cunning and resistance.\n\nAs the rebellion grows, the voice of Neil Morrissey, known for 'Can We Fix It?' becomes a rallying cry for change. The story of Marlon Brando's brief yet impactful role in 'Superman' inspires the rebels to make every moment count.\n\nFinally, in a game of cricket, the score of 111, known as 'Nelson,' becomes a secret code among the rebels, signaling hope and unity in their fight for freedom."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 10, "question_count": 10}], "model":

They also discovered an ancient storybook titled 'The Tenth Planet,' introducing them to the Cybermen, a tale that fascinated the birds.\n\nTheir journey took a sci-fi twist when they met a bird named David, who claimed to be the tenth Doctor of Bird Island, echoing David Tennant's role. He guided them to a hidden cave where they found 20 magical rings, similar to the Rings of Power, each glowing with a heliotrope hue, or purple.\n\nIn a surprising twist, they encountered Michelle, a bird who had left the island for Hollywood but returned after a failed attempt to become 'The Bionic Woman.' Finally, they reached a football field where Rodney, a bird with the middle name Charlton, helped them devise a plan to outsmart the pigs.\n\nWith teamwork and clever strategies, Red and his friends successfully retrieved their eggs, celebrating their victory with a grand feast on Bird Island."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["If you heard the catchphrase \"They're great\" what would expect to be advertised?", "How many times was Boris Becker runner-up in the Men's Singles at Wimbledon?", "How many times did Steffi Graf win the Ladies Singles at Wimbledon?", "Who did Top of the Pops mistakenly portray in a Dexys Midnight Runners song?", "What story introduced the Cybermen?", "Who played the tenth Doctor?", "How many Rings of Power were there, in total?", "Which common colour can also be known as heliotrope?", "Which actress left Eastenders for Hollywood only to flop as The Bionic Woman?", "In Only Fools And Horses, Rodney Trotter shares his middle name with which London football club?"], "answers": [["Frosted Rice", "Tiger Power", "Frosted Flakes", "Cinnamon Krunchers", "Kellog's Frosted Flakes", "Zucaritas", "Whole Grain Tiger Power", "They're gonna taste great", "Tony's Cinnamon Krunchers", "Frosted Flakes of Corn", "Cocoa Frosted Flakes", "Kellogg's Frosted Flakes", "List of Frosted Flakes Products", "Kellogg's Frosties", "Sugar Frosted Flakes", "Frosties", "frosted flakes of corn", "they re gonna taste great", "cocoa frosted flakes", "tony s cinnamon krunchers", "kellog s frosted flakes", "kellogg s frosties", "tiger power", "sugar frosted flakes", "frosted rice", "cinnamon krunchers", "whole grain tiger power", "zucaritas", "frosted flakes", "kellogg s frosted flakes", "list of frosted flakes products", "frosties"], ["four", "4", "four", "4"], ["seven", "7", "seven", "7"], ["Jocky Wilson", "Jockey Wilson", "Jockie Wilson", "jockie wilson", "jocky wilson", "jockey wilson"], ["The Tenth Planet", "Dr Who \u2013 Music from the Tenth Planet", "Dr Who - Music from the Tenth Planet", "The Tenth Planet (Doctor Who)", "dr who music from tenth planet", "tenth planet doctor who", "tenth planet", "dr who \u2013 music from tenth planet"], ["David Tennent", "THEDavidTennant", "Not Stalking David Tennant", "David tennant", "David tenant", "David Tennant", "David Tenant", "david tennant", "not stalking david tennant", "david tennent", "david tenant", "thedavidtennant"], ["twenty", "20", "20", "twenty"], ["Purplingly", "Purple (colour)", "Purplishness", "Purple", "Purpled", "Purplest", "Northwestern Purple (color)", "Heather Purple", "Words which rhyme with Purple", "Purpleish", "Purple flowers", "Purplishly", "Purpling", "Purple (color)", "List of terms associated with the color purple", "Purple vs. violet", "Purples", "Purpler", "northwestern purple color", "words which rhyme with purple", "purpleish", "purplishness", "purple flowers", "purpler", "purplingly", "purples", "purplishly", "purple", "purple color", "purple colour", "purple vs violet", "purpled", "list of terms associated with color purple", "heather purple", "purpling", "purplest"], ["Michelle Ryan", "Michelle Ryans", "Michele ryan", "michele ryan", "michelle ryan", "michelle ryans"], ["Charlton (disambiguation)", "Charlton", "charlton", "charlton disambiguation"]], "question_ids": ["qz_3878", "qz_3895", "qz_3898", "qz_3911", "qz_3920", "qz_3923", "qz_3927", "qz_3968", "qz_3971", "qz_3995"], "topic": "Angry Birds Movie"}}

The bus then zoomed to New York City in 1785, the bustling capital of the United States, where the students learned about the city's historical significance.\n\nNext, the bus transformed into a sleek Bond Bug, zipping through the streets as the students giggled at its quirky design. Their adventure continued on the high seas aboard the Calypso, Jacques Cousteau's famous oceanographic laboratory, where they explored the wonders of marine life.\n\nSuddenly, the bus morphed into Marine One, soaring through the skies as the students imagined themselves as presidents. They landed at St. Trinian's, a fictional girls' boarding school, where they met the mischievous students and learned about the importance of education.\n\nAs the day came to an end, the class gathered around Ms. Frizzle, who quoted George W. Bush, 'Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?' The students laughed, knowing they had learned so much. Finally, as they prepared to head home, Ms. Frizzle playfully asked, 'Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?' quoting Spike Milligan.\n\nWith a cheer, the Magic School Bus whisked them back to their classroom, their minds filled with new knowledge and unforgettable memories."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following that year's April Budget, Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, who later became Lord Mayor of London, bought the first what on 1 November 1956?", "Produced between 1970 and 1974, what is a Bond Bug?", "What was Jacques Cousteau's mobile oceonagraphic laboratory.", "What is the name of the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States", "Which queen consort of England is associated with Hever Castle in Kent?", "What was the capital of the United States between 1785 and 1790??", "Which fictional girls' boarding school was created by the cartoonist Ronald Searle", "Who played the character Mr Chips in the 2002 TV adaptation of Goodbye Mr Chips", "Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?", "Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?"], "answers": [["ERNIE", "Premium bond", "Premium bonds", "Premium Bond", "Premium Bonds", "Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment", "ernie", "premium bond", "premium bonds", "electronic random number indicator equipment"], ["Automotive vehicle", "Ottomobile", "Automobile", "Environmental impact of cars", "Self-rolling carriage", "\ud83d\ude97", "Motorcar", "\ud83d\ude98", "M1 vehicle", "Cardoor", "Motorization", "Automobil", "Automobiles", "Self-propelling carriage", "Passenger Vehicle", "Automobilism", "A car", "Car", "Motor car", "Passenger vehicles", "Motorisation", "Autos", "Automobles", "The Automobile", "Environmental impact of automobiles", "Motor-car", "Motor Car", "Car Automobile", "Cars", "Passenger vehicle", "automobilism", "automobil", "cars", "passenger vehicles", "autos", "environmental impact of automobiles", "automobile", "motorization", "\ud83d\ude97", "motor car", "automobiles", "\ud83d\ude98", "car", "automobles", "motorcar", "car automobile", "m1 vehicle", "self rolling carriage", "cardoor", "ottomobile", "passenger vehicle", "motorisation", "self propelling carriage", "automotive vehicle", "environmental impact of cars"], ["Calypso", "Callypso", "Calipso", "Calypsos", "Kalypso", "Calypso (disambiguation)", "kalypso", "callypso", "calypso", "calipso", "calypso disambiguation", "calypsos"], ["Marine Two", "Marine Corps One", "Marine One", "Marine I", "Marine one", "Marine 1", "Marine Corps 1", "Marine-One", "marine two", "marine corps one", "marine i", "marine one", "marine 1", "marine corps 1"], ["Anne Boylen", "Anne Bullen", "Anne boelyn", "Anne Boullant", "Ann Boleyn", "Anne Boleyn, 1st Marchioness of Pembroke", "Anne Boelyn", "Ann Bullen", "Anne Boleyn", "Anna Bollina", "Queen Anne Boleyn", "Anne Bolyn", "Anne boleyn", "Anne bolyn", "anne bullen", "anne boylen", "anne boleyn 1st marchioness of pembroke", "anna bollina", "anne bolyn", "ann bullen", "anne boullant", "queen anne boleyn", "ann boleyn", "anne boleyn", "anne boelyn"], ["New Yourk State", "State of N.Y.", "US-NY", "N Y", "The state of NY", "NewYork", "NYS", "Neo York", "NY state", "Nova York", "State of new york", "Ny", "New york", "Nueva York (estado)", "N Y state", "New York (state)", "U.S. state of New York", "New York state", "New York, U.S.", "State New York", "N\u00fdja-J\u00f3rv\u00edk", "Newyork", "NEW YORK", "State of N.

His mentor, Mr. Miyagi, had sent him on a quest to learn about the world beyond martial arts.\n\nDaniel\u2019s first stop was a film festival, where he watched \u2018Follow That Camel\u2019. He was surprised to see Phil Silvers, a US actor, replacing the iconic Sid James. Inspired by the film, Daniel decided to explore more about the world of cinema.\n\nHis journey took him to the 2010 Winter Olympics, where he marveled at the 37 medals won by the United States. The spirit of the athletes fueled his determination to excel in his own training.\n\nIn a quaint art gallery, Daniel stood mesmerized by \u2018The Weeping Woman\u2019, a masterpiece by Pablo Picasso. The painting\u2019s depth and emotion reminded him of the importance of expressing oneself, both in art and in life.\n\nAs he traveled, Daniel learned about the Koppen System, a classification for climates, which helped him understand the diverse environments he encountered. This knowledge was crucial when he found himself in a stormy region, much like the challenges he faced in his training.\n\nIn a small Greek village, an old storyteller recounted the tale of Tiresias, who disclosed the crimes of Oedipus. The story taught Daniel the value of truth and the courage to face one\u2019s past.\n\nWhile fishing with locals, Daniel learned to use a gaff, an iron hook, to land heavy fish. This skill mirrored the precision and strength required in karate.\n\nOne evening, around a campfire, a musician played \u2018Here Comes My Baby\u2019, a song written by Cat Stevens. The melody resonated with Daniel, reminding him of home and the loved ones waiting for his return.\n\nIn a humorous twist, Daniel met a quirky family, Mork and Mindy, and their child Mearth. Their antics brought laughter and joy, teaching him the importance of family and friendship.\n\nFinally, in Arkansas, Daniel discovered it was illegal to mispronounce the state\u2019s name. This quirky law made him appreciate the uniqueness of every place he visited.\n\nWith newfound wisdom and experiences, Daniel returned to Mr. Miyagi, ready to apply what he had learned to his martial arts and life."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task":

Their parents, inspired by the adventurous spirit of Winston Churchill, had once traveled the world together, but had since parted ways.\n\nDetermined to reunite their parents, the twins devised a plan. They remembered their father's fascination with numbers and how he often marveled at the word 'Thousand' for being the first number with an 'A.' They decided to use this as a clue in their treasure hunt to bring their parents back together.\n\nTheir journey took them to a cricket match, where they learned about Russell Endean's unusual dismissal for 'handling the ball.' This quirky fact became a part of their treasure map, leading them to the next clue.\n\nIn the African savannah, they encountered a friendly dik-dik, an antelope that guided them to a hidden message from their mother, who was a fan of Emilio Estevez's portrayal of Billy the Kid in 'Young Guns.'\n\nAs they traveled, Lily experienced chromotopsia, seeing the world in vibrant colors, which added a magical touch to their adventure. Their journey eventually led them to Italy, where the 1956 Winter Olympic Games were held, a place their parents had always dreamed of visiting together.\n\nAlong the way, they learned about the importance of the MMR vaccination, protecting them from diseases like Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. This knowledge became a metaphor for the protection and love they wished to restore in their family.\n\nFinally, they discovered a letter from their father, who had been inspired by the story of Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, and his battle with leprosy. The letter expressed his desire to overcome past challenges and reunite with their mother.\n\nWith the clues pieced together, the twins successfully brought their parents back together, proving that love, like a well-planned treasure hunt, can overcome any obstacle."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["The Strawberry Museum in the town of Wepion is in which country?", "Which British politician became Member of Parliament for Epping in October 1924?", "Which is the first written single word number in which the letter \u2018A\u2019 appears?", "In January 1957, Russell Endean became the first batsman to be dismissed from a test cricket match for doing what?", "What type of animal is a dik-dik?", "Who does Emilio Estevez play in the 1988 film \u2018Young Guns\u2019?", "In medicine, chromotopsia is the term for abnormally coloured what?", "Which European country hosted the 1956 Winter Olympic Games?", "In medicine the MMR vaccination gives protection against which diseases?", "What disease was Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, said to have died of in 1329?"], "answers": [["Belguim", "Koenigreich Belgien", "Belgium/Belgie", "Kingdom of Belgium", "Belgian", "Beljum", "K\u00f6nigreich Belgien", "Belgique", "Belgium", "Beligum", "Kingdom of the Belgians", "Beljam", "Kingdom Of Belgium", "Belgum", "ISO 3166-1:BE", "Belgie", "Cockpit of Europe", "Koninkrijk Belgi\u00eb", "Beldjike", "Blegium", "Belgio", "The Quebec of Europe", "Belgi\u00eb", "Begium", "Royaume de Belgique", "Konigreich Belgien", "Koninkrijk Belgie", "People of Belgium", "Belgien", "Belgium/facts", "Administrative divisions of Belgium", "Belgium facts", "cockpit of europe", "koninkrijk belgie", "k\u00f6nigreich belgien", "belgi\u00eb", "begium", "konigreich belgien", "belgie", "quebec of europe", "belgio", "iso 3166 1 be", "administrative divisions of belgium", "belgium facts", "koninkrijk belgi\u00eb", "belgique", "belgium", "beljam", "kingdom of belgians", "blegium", "belguim", "belgium belgie", "belgian", "belgum", "beldjike", "royaume de belgique", "beligum", "belgien", "people of belgium", "kingdom of belgium", "koenigreich belgien", "beljum"], ["Tango (cat)", "Death and state funeral of Winston Churchill", "Churchillian", "State funeral of Winston Churchill", "Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill", "Marigold Frances Churchill", "Sir winston hcurchill", "Winston Leonard Spencer", "Winston Spencer", "Winston Spencer-Churchill", "Sir Churchill", "Marigold Churchill", "Winnie Churchill", "Winston Churchill MP", "Winston churchill", "Prime Minister Churchill", "W.

I\u2019ll focus on how the numbers relate logically. For instance, combining 12 and 12 could give 24, but we need to find a way to use all the numbers. What about considering pairs of numbers and their divisors?\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"Let me automate part of this process. Based on past patterns, using multiplication and addition has frequently been successful in similar problems. Let\u2019s try pairing the numbers in various ways to find a straightforward solution.\"\nHippocampus: \"I recall a similar task where dividing 12 by 2 and then multiplying the result helped reach the target.

Master Splinter had tasked them with solving a mystery that spanned across time and space. Their first clue was hidden in a comic book, 'The Eagle,' published in April 1950. As they flipped through its pages, they found a map leading to the Manuel M. Torres Dam in Honduras.\n\n'We need to get to Honduras,' Leonardo declared, pointing at the map. 'But first, we need to decode this message using the NATO phonetic alphabet. It starts with 'India,' Raphael noted, scratching his head.\n\nMeanwhile, Donatello was busy researching. 'Did you know the meibomian gland is in the eyelid?' he said, trying to lighten the mood. 'And that the scapula connects the humerus with the clavicle?'\n\nMichelangelo, munching on a slice of pizza, chimed in, 'I bet Rebecca Adlington could swim across that dam faster than we can get there!'\n\nAs they prepared for their journey, they stumbled upon a book by Norman Mailer, 'The Naked and the Dead,' which contained another clue. 'This is getting as complicated as a novel by Frank McCourt,' Donatello sighed, thinking of the author with parents named Malachy and Angela.\n\nTheir adventure took them through the history of Britain, where they learned about Sir Robert Walpole, recognized as the first Prime Minister. Finally, they discovered the last clue in a dusty old bookshop: a copy of Wolf Mankowitz's 'A Kid For Two Farthings.'\n\nWith all the pieces in place, the Turtles solved the mystery, saving the day once again. 'Cowabunga!' they cheered, celebrating their victory with a well-deserved pizza party."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model":

Their journey began in the vibrant city of Eliot, named after the famous playwright T.S. Eliot, where they discovered a clue hidden in an old theater that once hosted 'The Music Man.'\n\nThe clue led them to the Hel Peninsula in Poland, where they encountered a wise Digimon who shared tales of the seaweed forests that produced agar-agar, a key ingredient in the local cuisine. As they traveled, they learned about the gestation period of elephants, a fact that would later prove crucial in solving the mystery.\n\nTheir adventure took them to Cambodia, where they noticed the 'KH' vehicle registration on a mysterious van. Inside, they found a map leading to a hidden laboratory where the 'Great Engineer,' Herbert Hoover, had been working on a new invention.\n\nAlong the way, they faced challenges reminiscent of 'Man v. Food,' where they had to consume vast amounts of custard, the English dessert known in France as Cr\u00e8me Anglaise. With each challenge, they grew stronger and more determined.\n\nFinally, they uncovered the secret of erotology, realizing it was the key to understanding the 'Great Engineer's' invention, which was designed to promote love and harmony in the digital world.

'Edward, what's going on?' she asked.\n\nEdward explained that he had been reading 'Bleak House' and got spooked by the character Inspector Bucket, which triggered his ommatophobia. Judy, with her usual charm, reassured him that there was nothing to fear and offered to help him find a solution.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick Wilde, Judy's fox partner, was investigating a separate case involving a hedgehog named Yona, who had been found with a case of heartburn after eating too many spicy snacks. Nick chuckled as he recalled how Yona had mistaken the snacks for a new type of shashlik.\n\nAs the day went on, Judy and Nick managed to solve both cases, bringing peace back to the market. They even had time to visit the PDSA, where they met a kind volunteer who shared stories about Maria Dickin, the founder of the charity.\n\nBy the end of the day, Judy and Nick were exhausted but satisfied, knowing they had made Zootopia a little bit better for everyone."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 6, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In medicine, pyrosis is the technical term for which condition?", "Shashlik is what type of food dish?", "Psychoanalyst A A Brill described what as \u2018Torches of Freedom\u2019 in the 1920\u2019s, as symbols of equality for women?", "In the novel \u2018Watership Down\u2019, Yona is what type of creature?", "Who became leader of the British Conservative Party in July 1965?", "What type of camel has two humps?", "Ommatophobia is the irrational fear of which part of the body?", "Inspector Bucket is a character in which novel by Charles Dickens?", "Who played factory boss Danny Baldwin in the British television soap \u2018Coronation Street\u2019?", "Maria Dickin was the founder of which British animal charity in 1917?"], "answers": [["Cardiac passion", "Acid indigestion", "Cardiacus dolor", "Heartburn", "Cardialgia", "Heart burn", "Agita", "Functional heartburn", "Cardialgy", "Ardor ventriculi", "cardialgia", "cardiacus dolor", "heart burn", "cardiac passion", "agita", "heartburn", "acid indigestion", "ardor ventriculi", "cardialgy", "functional heartburn"], ["Chenjeh Kebab", "Kebob", "Chapli kebab", "Testi Kebab", "Kakori Kebab", "Burrah Kebab", "Kababs", "Shish-kebab", "Kalmi Kebab", "Sultan's Feast", "Kalmi", "Kebabs", "Shish kebob", "Shishkabob", "Shishkebab", "Chapli Kebab", "Kabab", "Kabab Bakhtiari", "Qabab", "Kalmi kebab", "Kebab Kenjeh \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647", "Chelow Kebab", "Testi", "Iranian kabab", "Kabob", "Burrah", "Kabaab", "Bihari kebab", "Chapli kabab", "Sheesh kebab", "Steam kebab", "Shish kabob", "Shish-kabob", "Kebab", "Galouti", "Kebap", "Chapli Kabab", "Galouti Kebab", "Kebab restaurant", "shish kebob", "kebab kenjeh \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647", "kebob", "chapli kabab", "shish kabob", "kakori kebab", "kebab", "burrah", "steam kebab", "sultan s feast", "bihari kebab", "galouti kebab", "kababs", "kabab bakhtiari", "iranian kabab", "kabab", "kebabs", "sheesh kebab", "chapli kebab", "chenjeh kebab", "testi kebab", "kebap", "shish kebab", "kabob", "kalmi kebab", "kalmi", "testi", "shishkebab", "kebab restaurant", "burrah kebab", "galouti", "qabab", "chelow kebab", "shishkabob", "kabaab"], ["Ccigarette", "Cigarrette", "Cigarette butts", "Cigaretes", "Cciggarete", "European cigarettes", "Full flavor (cigarette type)", "Sickarette", "Full flavored cigarettes", "Ciggie", "Cigarette end", "Cigarete", "Cigerette", "Ciggy", "100mm cigarette", "Cigarette", "Fag (cigarette)", "Full Flavor (cigarette type)", "Cigarette tube", "Lung rocket", "Cigarrete", "Cigaret", "Cig", "Coffin Nail", "Cigarette litter", "Smokes", "Cigarettes", "Cancer stick", "Cigs", "Cancer Stick", "Cigarette ash", "Loosey", "Ciggarette", "Tobacco cigarette", "Cigerettes", "Dog end", "Cigarette butt", "ciggy", "loosey", "cigarrete", "cigarettes", "cigarette litter", "lung rocket", "ccigarette", "smokes", "cigerette", "ciggarette", "ciggie", "fag cigarette", "cigs", "full flavored cigarettes", "cigarete", "cigaretes", "european cigarettes", "dog end", "cigarette", "cigarette tube", "cigarette butts", "cigerettes", "cigarette butt", "100mm cigarette", "cigaret", "coffin nail", "cigarette ash", "cigarette end", "sickarette", "tobacco cigarette", "cciggarete", "full flavor cigarette type", "cig", "cigarrette", "cancer stick"], ["Domestic Hedgehog", "Hedgepig", "Erinaceinae", "Hedge hog", "Hedge Hog", "Hedgehogs", "Hedgehog", "hedgepig", "domestic hedgehog", "hedgehogs", "erinaceinae", "hedge hog", "hedgehog"], ["Sir Edward Heath", "Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath II", "Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath (1974\u20131975)", "Edward Heath", "Edward Richard George Heath", "Ted Heath", "Edward R.

The program was designed to teach them about the world beyond their usual mischief. \n\nOne day, while the Minions were learning about famous professions, they stumbled upon a lesson about sports agents, inspired by the movie 'Jerry Maguire.' Intrigued, they decided to become sports agents for a day, trying to sign Oasis, the band known for their debut album 'Definitely Maybe,' to perform at Gru's next big event.\n\nMeanwhile, Gru was busy in his lab, humming 'Sing a Song of Sixpence' as he worked on a new invention. He was interrupted by a call from his old friend, Woody Harrelson, who needed help with a bounty hunter mission. Gru, always up for an adventure, agreed to assist.\n\nAs the Minions continued their studies, they learned about the Anderson family, famous for their contributions to comedy, music, and sports. Inspired, they decided to host a talent show featuring their own comedic and musical talents.\n\nGru's mission with Woody took him to Washington DC, where they uncovered a plot reminiscent of 'All the President's Men.' They navigated through secret passages hidden behind Shoji doors, eventually foiling the plan with the help of a friendly rinkhals snake they befriended along the way.\n\nIn the end, Gru and the Minions returned home, having learned about history, culture, and the importance of teamwork.

He recalled how Edmund Cartwright's invention of the power loom in 1784 revolutionized the textile industry, much like how the introduction of the Jet Ski by Kawasaki in 1972 changed water sports forever.\n\nWhile exploring a local market, Lennard noticed a vendor selling badminton shuttlecocks, each meticulously crafted with 16 feathers.

Inspired by the legendary chef Gusteau, he wanted to cook the finest dishes. One day, while exploring the city, Remy stumbled upon a hidden alley where he found an old cinema playing 'Steamboat Willie.' The film sparked his imagination, reminding him that even the smallest creatures can make a big impact.\n\nAs Remy scurried through the streets, he passed a Buick showroom, where the shiny cars gleamed like the trophies of Steffi Graf, the tennis champion he admired. He imagined himself winning the culinary championship of Paris, much like Steffi's Wimbledon victory.\n\nRemy\u2019s journey was not without challenges. He had to dodge the watchful eyes of the kitchen staff, much like a 'watchdog' guarding its territory. But with the agility of an 'eyas,' he maneuvered through the kitchen, using a 'jackknife' to slice ingredients with precision.\n\nIn the heart of the kitchen, Remy met a young chef named Linguini, who was as nervous as a 'catwalk' model before a big show. Together, they created dishes that dazzled the taste buds, earning the admiration of food critics, including the esteemed Gisele B\u00fcndchen of the culinary world.\n\nAs the night ended, Remy realized that his 'sidewalk' adventure had led him to discover his true 'side ability'\u2014the power to bring joy through food. And just like Golda Meir, who rose to prominence from humble beginnings, Remy knew that with determination and a little bit of magic, anything was possible."], "parsing_success_flag": [true],

Her journey led her to a mysterious forest where she encountered Bok, a stone gargoyle who guarded the secrets of the enchanted Rubik\u2019s Cube, each side adorned with 9 mystical squares.\n\nAs Mulan ventured deeper, she met the wise Brockman family, who shared tales of the elusive louvar fish that swam in the hidden lakes. They spoke of Queen Joan of Navarre, whose spirit lingered in the forest, guiding Mulan with the wisdom of her step-son, the great King Henry V.\n\nIn her travels, Mulan befriended a trio of squirrels\u2014Grizzled Giant, Southern Flying, and Provost\u2019s\u2014who aided her with their agility and knowledge of the forest paths. Her journey took a turn when she encountered a wise old man named Andrew Bonar Law, who spoke of leadership and courage, much like the tales of Emelius Browne and his magical adventures in 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks.'\n\nAs night fell, Mulan witnessed a dazzling display of Catherine wheels lighting up the sky, a reminder of the trials and triumphs of her journey. With newfound strength and the wisdom of the ages, Mulan solved the enchanted Rubik\u2019s Cube, revealing the number 12, a symbol of her completed quest and the harmony she restored to her land."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 10, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What is the name of the villain Azal\u2019s gargoyle servant in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who?", "How many squares does a Rubik\u2019s Cube have on each side?", "What is the surname of the family in the BBC comedy series \u2018Outnumbered\u2019?", "What type of creature is a louvar?", "Queen Joan of Navarre, who was imprisoned for witchcraft, was the stepmother of which English monarch?", "Grizzled Giant, Southern Flying and Provost\u2019s are all types of which creature?", "Who became British Prime Minister in October 1922?", "Emelius Browne, Mr Jelk and Colonel Heller are all characters in which Disney film?", "Which firework is said to be named after an instrument of torture on which a saint is said to have been martyred?", "What is the square root of 144?"], "answers": [["Bok (crater)", "Bok (disambiguation)", "BOK", "Boek", "Bok", "B\u00f6k", "\u0411\u043e\u043a", "bok", "bok crater", "\u0431\u043e\u043a", "b\u00f6k", "bok disambiguation", "boek"], ["9", "nine", "nine", "9"], ["Brockman", "brockman"], ["Fish proteins", "Fin-fish", "Fish vs fishes", "Ichthyoid", "Fish versus fishes", "\ud83d\udc1f", "Fish (Biology)", "Fishes or fish", "Piscines", "Fish or fishes", "Fisshes", "Fishes", "Fishes versus fish", "Fush", "Sick fish", "Fishbones", "Pisces (zoology)", "Finfish", "Marine fish", "Fish (zoology)", "Ichthyes", "Fish", "Ichthyofauna", "Inchthyic", "Fish venoms", "\ud83d\udc1f", "finfish", "marine fish", "fishes or fish", "fisshes", "sick fish", "ichthyofauna", "fishbones", "fishes", "inchthyic", "fush", "fish vs fishes", "fishes versus fish", "fish proteins", "fish or fishes", "fish", "fish biology", "piscines", "ichthyoid", "fin fish", "fish versus fishes", "ichthyes", "fish venoms", "pisces zoology", "fish zoology"], ["Henry 5", "Henri V", "Henry V (film)", "Hendrik V", "Henry 5th", "Henry V", "Enrico V", "Henry V (disambiguation)", "Enrique V", "Henry the Fifth", "Heinrich V", "henry v film", "henri v", "henry v", "enrico v", "henry 5", "enrique v", "heinrich v", "henry 5th", "hendrik v", "henry fifth", "henry v disambiguation"], ["Skiouros", "Squirrell", "Squirell", "Squirel", "Scuridae", "Eichhornchen", "Squirl", "Squirrels", "Eichhoernchen", "Sciuridae", "Eichh\u00f6rnchen", "Rats with bushy tails", "Scuiridae", "Squirrel", "Bushy tailed tree rat", "Bigtail rat", "Sciurid", "Squirrl", "squirrels", "squirrl", "eichhornchen", "scuiridae", "squirell", "skiouros", "sciuridae", "squirrell", "scuridae", "squirrel", "rats with bushy tails", "bushy tailed tree rat", "bigtail rat", "eichhoernchen", "sciurid", "squirel", "squirl", "eichh\u00f6rnchen"], ["Annie Bonar Law", "Andrew Bonar Law", "Andrew Bonar-Law", "A Bonar Law", "Boner law", "Bonar-Law", "Bonar Law", "Unknown Prime Minister", "annie bonar law", "unknown prime minister", "bonar law", "boner law", "andrew bonar law"], ["Bedknobs And Broomsticks", "Bedknobs and Broomsticks", "Roy Snart", "Isle of Naboombu", "Ian Weighill", "Bedknobs & Broomsticks", "Island of Naboombu", "Bedknobs an broomsticks", "Bedknobs and broomsticks", "bedknobs broomsticks", "bedknobs and broomsticks", "island of naboombu", "ian weighill", "roy snart", "isle of naboombu"], ["Catherine Wheel", "catherine wheel"], ["twelve", "12", "twelve", "12"]], "question_ids": ["qb_7891", "qb_7894", "qb_7906", "qb_7916", "qb_7920", "qb_7931", "qb_7937", "qb_7942", "qb_7956", "qb_7961"], "topic": "Mulan"}}

They were known throughout the forest for their tales of bravery and humor, much like the stories of 'Dad\u2019s Army' they often recounted.\n\nAs Bambi wandered further, he stumbled upon a curious frog named Roosevelt Franklin, who loved to sing and dance, bringing joy to all the forest creatures.\n\nNearby, an old building stood, known as the Magdalene Laundry, where the forest animals would gather to wash their clothes and share stories of the past.\n\nBambi's friend, a clever fox, explained that 'Boat Race' was a funny way to say 'face,' a term he learned from the city folk.\n\nIn the river, Bambi spotted a sterlet, a type of sturgeon, gracefully swimming against the current, a sight that filled him with wonder.\n\nLater, Bambi met a kind nurse named Mildred, who took care of the animals when they were sick, much like Nurse Ratched from the stories his mother told him.\n\nIn the evening, Bambi and his friends gathered around a magical device called Ceefax, which showed them news and stories from faraway lands.\n\nAs the sun set, Bambi listened to the tales of Peter O'Toole, a wise old stag who shared his adventures of 'Loitering With Intent.'\n\nFinally, Bambi's day ended with a visit from Hawkeye, a brave frontiersman deer, who shared stories of courage and friendship, inspiring Bambi to be brave and kind.\n\nAnd so, Bambi's adventure in the forest was filled

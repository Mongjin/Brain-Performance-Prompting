Her love for tales began when she first watched \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" enchanted by the song \"If I Were A Rich Man.\" The melody lingered in her mind, sparking dreams of adventure and discovery.\n\nOne day, while exploring an old bookstore, Elsa stumbled upon a dusty copy of \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" Intrigued, she learned that it was the precursor to \"Men Against the Sea\" and \"Pitcairn's Island.\" The tales of high seas and distant lands captivated her imagination, much like the stories of Truman Capote, whose original last name was Persons before his adoption.\n\nElsa's curiosity led her to delve into Lewis Carroll's whimsical world, where she discovered \"The Hunting of the Snark.\" She marveled at the cleverness of the snark, which turned into a boojum to fool its hunters, a reminder of the unexpected twists life often presented.\n\nHer journey through stories also took her to biblical tales, where she read about Joshua, the leader before whom the sun and moon stood still.

It was a name that carried history and mystery, much like the tales Simba had uncovered on his journey.\n\nWith a heart full of stories and a mind enriched by the wisdom of the past, Simba returned to his pride, ready to share the lessons he had learned and the melodies that had accompanied him along the way."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 10, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which state was Gene Vincent born?", "Brandon Lee died during the making of which movie?", "Who had a 70s No 1 hit with Let's Do It Again?", "Who had a Too Legit To Quit Tour?", "\"According to Rudyard Kipling what were the \"\"two imposters\"\" to meet and treat the same day?\"", "Who is the most successful UK solo artist in the USA?", "Which country does the airline TAAG come from?", "Which US No 1 single came from Diana Ross's platinum album Diana?", "River Phoenix died during the making of which movie?", "What is Mel Gibson's middle name?"], "answers": [["US-VA", "State of Virginia", "Virginia, USA", "Tenth State", "Religion in Virginia", "Virginia (USA state)", "Virginia (state)", "Commonwealth of VA", "Rest of Virginia", "Virginia", "Mother of Presidents", "Virginia (USA State)", "The Old Dominion", "VA (state)", "Commonwealth of Virginia", "Virginian Commonwealth", "The Mother of Presidents", "Virginia, United States", "Council of Virginia", "Sports in Virginia", "Viginia", "Virginia (U.S. state)", "10th State", "Virgina", "The Commonwealth of Virginia", "VA, USA", "Virginia (State)", "commonwealth of virginia", "sports in virginia", "va state", "rest of virginia", "va usa", "virginia usa state", "10th state", "virginian commonwealth", "us va", "tenth state", "viginia", "commonwealth of va", "mother of presidents", "virginia", "virginia united states", "council of virginia", "virginia usa", "virgina", "old dominion", "state of virginia", "religion in virginia", "virginia state", "virginia u s state"], ["The Crow: Dead Time", "The Crow (2016 film)", "The Crow", "crow", "crow dead time", "crow 2016 film"], ["The Staple Singers", "Staple Singers", "The Staples Singers", "Staples Singers", "Cleotha Staples", "cleotha staples", "staple singers", "staples singers"], ["M.

It all began when Andy's family decided to take a trip to Wisconsin, home to Truax Field International Airport. As the toys secretly tagged along, they stumbled upon a mysterious old map tucked away in the attic.\n\nThe map, as it turned out, was a historical artifact, leading them on a journey through time. Their first stop was the year 1993, where they learned about Ezer Weizman, who had just become Israel's head of state. Intrigued by the stories of leadership, Woody and Buzz were inspired to lead their toy friends with even more dedication.\n\nTheir next destination was a somber chapter in history, as they found themselves in the midst of WWII. Here, they learned about Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the Nazi party's security service. The toys were reminded of the importance of standing up against tyranny and protecting each other.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they found themselves near the Gulf of Mexico, in the state of Texas, which is nearest the end of the alphabet among the Gulf states. The warm breeze and the sound of the waves were a welcome respite from their travels.\n\nThe map then guided them to the 1904 Olympics, where they discovered that American athletes had won 19 of the 23 track and field titles. The toys were inspired by the athletes' determination and teamwork, qualities they knew were essential in their own adventures.\n\nTheir journey took them next to the Black Hills, nestled between the Cheyenne and Belle Fourche rivers. The natural beauty of the landscape reminded them of the importance of preserving the world for future generations of toys and humans alike.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the map transported them to 1921, the year the first in-flight movie was shown on an internal flight in the USA. The toys marveled at the innovation and how it brought joy to travelers, much like their own adventures brought joy to Andy.\n\nTheir historical journey took a dramatic turn when they witnessed the infamous moment in November 1963, when Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald. The toys were reminded of the fragility of life and the impact of pivotal moments in history.\n\nAs they continued, they learned about Chuck Yeager, the first American to travel faster than the speed of sound. Buzz, always fascinated by flight, was particularly inspired by Yeager's bravery and pioneering spirit.\n\nFinally, the map led them to a more personal moment in history, when Barbara Walters interviewed President Jimmy Carter, the first US president she interviewed.

It all began when Andy's family decided to take a trip to Wisconsin, home to Truax Field International Airport. As the toys secretly tagged along, they stumbled upon a mysterious old map tucked away in the attic.\n\nThe map, as it turned out, was a historical artifact, leading them on a journey through time. Their first stop was the year 1993, where they learned about Ezer Weizman, who had just become Israel's head of state. Intrigued by the stories of leadership, Woody and Buzz were inspired to lead their toy friends with even more dedication.\n\nTheir next destination was a somber chapter in history, as they found themselves in the midst of WWII. Here, they learned about Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the Nazi party's security service. The toys were reminded of the importance of standing up against tyranny and protecting each other.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they found themselves near the Gulf of Mexico, in the state of Texas, which is nearest the end of the alphabet among the Gulf states. The warm breeze and the sound of the waves were a welcome respite from their travels.\n\nThe map then guided them to the 1904 Olympics, where they discovered that American athletes had won 19 of the 23 track and field titles. The toys were inspired by the athletes' determination and teamwork, qualities they knew were essential in their own adventures.\n\nTheir journey took them next to the Black Hills, nestled between the Cheyenne and Belle Fourche rivers. The natural beauty of the landscape reminded them of the importance of preserving the world for future generations of toys and humans alike.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the map transported them to 1921, the year the first in-flight movie was shown on an internal flight in the USA. The toys marveled at the innovation and how it brought joy to travelers, much like their own adventures brought joy to Andy.\n\nTheir historical journey took a dramatic turn when they witnessed the infamous moment in November 1963, when Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald. The toys were reminded of the fragility of life and the impact of pivotal moments in history.\n\nAs they continued, they learned about Chuck Yeager, the first American to travel faster than the speed of sound. Buzz, always fascinated by flight, was particularly inspired by Yeager's bravery and pioneering spirit.\n\nFinally, the map led them to a more personal moment in history, when Barbara Walters interviewed President Jimmy Carter, the first US president she interviewed. The toys realized the power of communication and storytelling in shaping the world.\n\nWith their journey complete, Woody and Buzz returned to Andy's room, their hearts full of new stories and lessons. They knew that, like the historical figures they had learned about, they too had the power to make a difference in their own small world."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos":

Kennedy.\"\n\nSuddenly, the room transformed into a dartboard. \"What is the minimum number of darts needed to complete a leg from 501?\" Thor, surprisingly adept at darts, declared, \"Nine!\" The board flashed green, and the team moved on.\n\nThe next challenge was a football pitch. \"What was the first British football team to win the European Cup?\" Bruce Banner, always the researcher, answered, \"Celtic.\"\n\nThe room then filled with dominoes. \"How many pieces are there in a standard set of dominoes?\" Wanda Maximoff, using her powers to count quickly, said, \"28.\"\n\nThe simulation took a cosmic turn, showing images of space. \"What were Benjy and Laska, sent into space in 1958?\" Vision, with his vast database, replied, \"They were dogs.\"\n\nThe scene shifted to the London Underground. \"Which is the only line to connect at some point with every other line on the system?\" Peter Parker, having recently visited London, answered, \"The Jubilee Line.\"\n\nFinally, the room dimmed, and a lightbulb appeared. \"True or False: Thomas Edison, who invented the lightbulb, was afraid of the dark?\" Tony Stark, with a smirk, said, \"True.\"\n\nWith all questions answered correctly, the simulation ended, and the Avengers found themselves back in the training room. Tony grinned, \"Not only did you all prove your combat skills, but you also showed you're quite the trivia buffs.\"\n\nThe team laughed, realizing that even superheroes could learn something new every day."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was advertised with Eva Herzagovia using the slogan hello boys?", "What number in Bingo is sometimes referred to as Heinz varieties?", "As at March 2001, who holds the record for scoring the most league goals for the soccer team Arsenal?", "Who was the American President when the Berlin Wall was constructed?", "What is the minimum number of darts a person needs to throw to complete a leg from 501?", "What was the first British football team to win the European Cup?", "How many pieces are there in a standard set of dominoes?", "What were Benjy and Laska, which were sent into space in 1958?", "On the London Underground, which is the only line to connect at some point with every other line on the system?", "Thomas Edison, who invented the lightbulb, was afraid of the dark?"], "answers": [["Wonderbra.", "Wonder-bra", "The Wonderbra", "WonderBra", "Wonderbra", "The Wonder-Bra", "Wonder Bra", "Wonderbra Women", "wonderbra", "wonderbra women", "wonder bra"], ["57", "fifty-seven", "fifty seven", "57"], ["Mr Wright", "Ian Wright", "ian wright", "mr wright"], ["JFK", "J.F.K", "J.F.K.

Pippin had always been fascinated by tales from the world beyond the Shire, and one day, he stumbled upon an ancient book in the library of Bag End. The book was filled with stories and trivia from lands far and wide, and Pippin was eager to learn more.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages, he read about a peculiar Channel 4 TV show called \"The Word,\" which had presenters like Mark Lamarr, Amanda De Cadenet, and Terry Christian. Pippin chuckled at the thought of such a lively show, imagining how it might entertain the hobbits during their evening gatherings.\n\nFurther along, he discovered that in 2004, a talented athlete named Maria Sharapova won the Ladies singles title at Wimbledon. Pippin marveled at the idea of such a grand sporting event, wondering if hobbits could ever compete in such a thing.\n\nThe book also mentioned the year 303 AD, the time when St George, the legendary dragon-slayer, had died. Pippin was particularly intrigued by this tale, as it reminded him of the brave deeds of his own ancestors.\n\nAs he continued reading, Pippin learned about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death.

Pippin had always been fascinated by tales from the world beyond the Shire, and one day, he stumbled upon an ancient book in the library of Bag End. The book was filled with stories and trivia from lands far and wide, and Pippin was eager to learn more.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages, he read about a peculiar Channel 4 TV show called \"The Word,\" which had presenters like Mark Lamarr, Amanda De Cadenet, and Terry Christian. Pippin chuckled at the thought of such a lively show, imagining how it might entertain the hobbits during their evening gatherings.\n\nFurther along, he discovered that in 2004, a talented athlete named Maria Sharapova won the Ladies singles title at Wimbledon. Pippin marveled at the idea of such a grand sporting event, wondering if hobbits could ever compete in such a thing.\n\nThe book also mentioned the year 303 AD, the time when St George, the legendary dragon-slayer, had died. Pippin was particularly intrigued by this tale, as it reminded him of the brave deeds of his own ancestors.\n\nAs he continued reading, Pippin learned about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death. The thought of such ominous figures sent a shiver down his spine, but he was comforted by the knowledge that they were merely part of an ancient myth.\n\nThe book also spoke of Dick Cheney, who served as Vice-President for George W.

Along the way, they stumbled upon a quaint little cottage where the Broons and Oor Wullie, characters from a Scottish newspaper, were having a lively discussion about their latest adventures.\n\nAs they continued, the air was filled with the melody of a Christmas song, one that included the line, \"It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle.'\" The tune was being played by a band of merry creatures, led by a British footballer with the most international caps, who was also an avid musician.\n\nTheir path led them to a vibrant garden party, where a statue of a man holding a trumpet caught Alice's eye. It was none other than the likeness of Paul McCartney from the album cover of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" The party was in full swing, with a band playing a song that began with the line, \"The taxman's taken all my dough.\"\n\nAs the sun began to set, Alice and Stripes found themselves outside a pub known as The Blind Beggar, infamous for being the site where the Kray twins were convicted of the murder of George Cornell. The atmosphere was tense, but Alice's curiosity was piqued by the stories of the past.\n\nTheir final stop was a grand theater, where the iconic theme of the Pink Panther, composed by Henry Mancini, echoed through the halls. The performance was attended by a glamorous actress, Meg Ryan, who had once married Dennis Quaid on Valentine's Day in 1991.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Alice realized that Wonderland was a place where stories intertwined, and every character, whether from a film, a novel, or a song, had a tale to tell. With a heart full of wonder, she bid farewell to Stripes and the enchanting world, knowing she could return whenever her imagination desired."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What type of animal is the star of the 2005 film Racing Stripes?", "Author Dick Francis is famous for writing novels based around which sport?", "Which Scottish newspaper features the Broons and Oor Wullie?", "Which Christmas song includes the line It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle'?", "Which British footballer has the most number of International caps?", "Who holds a trumpet on the album cover of Sgt.

It all started when he found an old stone tablet with mysterious inscriptions. Intrigued, he decided to take it to his friend Barney Rubble for a closer look.\n\nAs they examined the tablet, they realized it was a map leading to a hidden treasure. Excited, they set off on an adventure, humming tunes to keep their spirits high. Fred couldn't help but sing \"Only You,\" a catchy tune he remembered from a group called The Flying Pickets, who had a Christmas number one hit back in 1983.\n\nTheir journey took them past the local Bedrock newspaper office, where they noticed a new, tiny edition called the \"Berliner\" on display. It was the smallest size of newspaper they had ever seen, and Fred joked about how it would be perfect for Dino to read.\n\nAs they continued, Fred mentioned to Barney that he and Wilma were soon celebrating their first wedding anniversary, which was traditionally marked with paper. Barney, always the jokester, suggested they gift each other a song called \"Paper\" by the American rap artist Queen Latifah, released in 1998.\n\nTheir path led them through a rocky terrain reminiscent of the Giro D'Italia, which Ivan Basso had won in 2010. Fred, feeling competitive, challenged Barney to a race, but they quickly tired and decided to walk instead.\n\nAs they neared their destination, they passed a field where a local athlete was practicing. Fred recalled hearing about a British athlete named Leon Baptiste, who had won the men's 200m gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. Inspired, Fred and Barney cheered him on.\n\nFinally, they arrived at a quaint cottage that reminded Fred of Anne Hathaway's cottage in Shottery, Warwickshire. It was here that they found the treasure\u2014a collection of ancient music records. Among them was a record by Lily Allen, who had won three Ivor Novello awards, including songwriter of the year for her hit single, \"The Fear.\"\n\nAs they celebrated their find, they decided to play one of the records. To their surprise, it was the theme song for the TV show \"Rawhide,\" sung by Frankie Laine.

It wove together the lives of historical figures and legends, from the civil rights leader Steve Biko, whose life was depicted in the 1987 film \"Cry Freedom,\" to the Brazilian tennis champion Maria Bueno, who triumphed at Wimbledon in 1959, 1960, and 1964.\n\nThe tale began with a journey on the Mallard, the steam locomotive that set the world speed record in July 1938. The train carried its passengers to the legendary venue Bono once called \"Rock and roll\u2019s great cathedral,\" where music and magic intertwined.\n\nAs Valerie's story unfolded, it introduced the enigmatic figure of Bodhidharma, the 5th/6th Century Buddhist monk known in Chinese texts as \"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian.\" His teachings of peace and enlightenment resonated with the characters, guiding them through trials and tribulations.\n\nThe climax of the story took place in the year 1971, the only year a British commercial flight was hijacked. In Valerie's tale, the hijacking was a metaphor for the characters' struggles to find their true selves amidst chaos and confusion.\n\nFinally, the story concluded aboard the majestic Cunard ocean liner, the RMS Mauretania, launched on 20th September 1906. As the ship sailed into the sunset, the characters found solace and understanding, their souls laid bare yet unburdened.\n\nValerie's story captivated the audience, leaving them with a sense of wonder and introspection. In Sandlot, where history and imagination danced hand in hand, the festival was a reminder that the past and present are forever intertwined, and that the windows to our souls are opened not by force, but by the gentle touch of understanding and empathy."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "",

Twins Lily and Rose, separated at birth, had unknowingly crossed paths at a summer camp in the picturesque countryside. Their discovery of each other was as unexpected as the letter 'A' appearing in the first written single word number, \"one thousand.\"\n\nDetermined to reunite their estranged parents, the twins concocted a plan reminiscent of a classic Parent Trap. Their father, a history enthusiast, was particularly fascinated by British politics and often recounted tales of Winston Churchill, who became Member of Parliament for Epping in October 1924. Their mother, on the other hand, was a cricket aficionado, intrigued by the story of Russell Endean, the first batsman dismissed for \"obstructing the field\" in a test match in January 1957.\n\nThe twins decided to orchestrate a family trip to the 1956 Winter Olympic Games' host country, Italy, under the guise of visiting the Strawberry Museum. Their plan was as intricate as the vibrant hues seen in chromotopsia, a condition where vision is abnormally colored.\n\nDuring the trip, the family encountered a dik-dik, a small antelope native to Africa, which sparked a conversation about Emilio Estevez's portrayal of Billy the Kid in the 1988 film \"Young Guns.\" This light-hearted moment helped ease the tension between their parents.\n\nAs the family explored the museum, the twins revealed their true intentions.

Twins Lily and Rose, separated at birth, had unknowingly crossed paths at a summer camp in the picturesque countryside. Their discovery of each other was as unexpected as the letter 'A' appearing in the first written single word number, \"one thousand.\"\n\nDetermined to reunite their estranged parents, the twins concocted a plan reminiscent of a classic Parent Trap. Their father, a history enthusiast, was particularly fascinated by British politics and often recounted tales of Winston Churchill, who became Member of Parliament for Epping in October 1924. Their mother, on the other hand, was a cricket aficionado, intrigued by the story of Russell Endean, the first batsman dismissed for \"obstructing the field\" in a test match in January 1957.\n\nThe twins decided to orchestrate a family trip to the 1956 Winter Olympic Games' host country, Italy, under the guise of visiting the Strawberry Museum. Their plan was as intricate as the vibrant hues seen in chromotopsia, a condition where vision is abnormally colored.\n\nDuring the trip, the family encountered a dik-dik, a small antelope native to Africa, which sparked a conversation about Emilio Estevez's portrayal of Billy the Kid in the 1988 film \"Young Guns.\" This light-hearted moment helped ease the tension between their parents.\n\nAs the family explored the museum, the twins revealed their true intentions. They reminded their parents of the importance of unity, much like the MMR vaccination protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. The parents, touched by their daughters' efforts, began to reconcile.\n\nIn a poignant moment, the family visited a nearby historical site dedicated to Robert the Bruce, the King of Scotland, who was said to have died of leprosy in 1329.

The Teletubbies listened in awe, imagining the excitement of the match.\n\nLaa-Laa, always fascinated by nature, had discovered a book about trees and was eager to share her newfound knowledge.

It was a hilarious sight, with each Teletubby pretending to be a majestic bird of prey.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Mr. Bean made a surprise visit in his iconic lime green Mini, a 1977 British Leyland Mini 1000.

Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa, and Po had decided to host a celebration inspired by the world beyond their hills.\n\nThe theme of the day was \"World Wonders,\" and each Teletubby was tasked with bringing something unique to the party. Tinky Winky, with his love for flags, decided to showcase the national flag of Greenland, which was a striking combination of red and white. He draped it proudly over a hill, its colors contrasting beautifully with the lush landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, Dipsy, who had recently taken an interest in sports history, recounted the thrilling tale of Italy's victory over Hungary in the 1938 FIFA World Cup, where they triumphed with a score of 4-2. The Teletubbies listened in awe, imagining the excitement of the match.\n\nLaa-Laa, always fascinated by nature, had discovered a book about trees and was eager to share her newfound knowledge. She explained that Yellow-pine, Uinta, and Lodgepole were all types of trees, not animals, much to the surprise of her friends.\n\nPo, the smallest and most curious of the group, had been watching human movies on her tummy screen. She was particularly taken with the 2002 film \"Scooby-Doo\" and was eager to tell everyone about Sarah Michelle Gellar, who played the character Daphne.\n\nAs the day went on, the Teletubbies decided to play a game using the NATO phonetic alphabet. They giggled as they took turns saying words like \"Charlie\" for the letter 'C', each trying to outdo the other with their pronunciation.\n\nIn a quiet moment, Tinky Winky shared a story he had read by a former RAF pilot named Arthur Hailey, who wrote the novel \"Airport.\" The tale of high-flying adventures captivated the Teletubbies, who imagined themselves soaring through the skies.\n\nLater, they tried their hand at falconry, using a creance, the long fine cord used in the sport, to guide their imaginary falcons. It was a hilarious sight, with each Teletubby pretending to be a majestic bird of prey.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Mr. Bean made a surprise visit in his iconic lime green Mini, a 1977 British Leyland Mini 1000. The Teletubbies were thrilled, and they all took turns sitting in the driver's seat, pretending to drive around Teletubbyland.\n\nBefore the day ended, they reflected on how things had changed over the years. Tinky Winky mentioned how it became compulsory to wear seat belts in the front seats of cars in the UK in 1983, a fact he found fascinating.\n\nFinally, as they gathered for Tubby Toast, they remembered the story of Boutros Ghali, the Prime Minister of Egypt who was assassinated in 1910. It was a somber moment, but it reminded them of the importance of peace and friendship.\n\nWith the stars twinkling above, the Teletubbies ended their day of world wonders, grateful for the stories and knowledge they had shared."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method":

Somebody had to,\" in his book \"The Lost Continent.\"\n\nThe game was as unpredictable as ever, with hedgehogs rolling in every direction. Among the players was Al Pacino, the actor who succeeded Marlon Brando as the head of the Corleone family in the Godfather films. He was surprisingly adept at the game, much to everyone's amusement.\n\nAfter the match, Rainbow Brite decided to relax by a nearby stream, where she spotted several types of fish, including Brown, American Rainbow, and Cutthroat trout, swimming gracefully in the clear water. She sipped on a vibrant purple liqueur called Parfait d\u2019Amour, enjoying its unique flavor.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Rainbow Brite reflected on the day's adventures.

As the sun set over the skyline, Judy and Nick shared a moment of triumph, knowing that in Zootopia, peace and equality were always worth fighting for."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In medicine, pyrosis is the technical term for which condition?", "Shashlik is what type of food dish?", "Psychoanalyst A A Brill described what as \u2018Torches of Freedom\u2019 in the 1920\u2019s, as symbols of equality for women?", "In the novel \u2018Watership Down\u2019, Yona is what type of creature?", "Who became leader of the British Conservative Party in July 1965?", "What type of camel has two humps?", "Ommatophobia is the irrational fear of which part of the body?", "Inspector Bucket is a character in which novel by Charles Dickens?", "Who played factory boss Danny Baldwin in the British television soap \u2018Coronation Street\u2019?", "Maria Dickin was the founder of which British animal charity in 1917?"], "answers": [["Cardiac passion", "Acid indigestion", "Cardiacus dolor", "Heartburn", "Cardialgia", "Heart burn", "Agita", "Functional heartburn", "Cardialgy", "Ardor ventriculi", "cardialgia", "cardiacus dolor", "heart burn", "cardiac passion", "agita", "heartburn", "acid indigestion", "ardor ventriculi", "cardialgy", "functional heartburn"], ["Chenjeh Kebab", "Kebob", "Chapli kebab", "Testi Kebab", "Kakori Kebab", "Burrah Kebab", "Kababs", "Shish-kebab", "Kalmi Kebab", "Sultan's Feast", "Kalmi", "Kebabs", "Shish kebob", "Shishkabob", "Shishkebab", "Chapli Kebab", "Kabab", "Kabab Bakhtiari", "Qabab", "Kalmi kebab", "Kebab Kenjeh \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647", "Chelow Kebab", "Testi", "Iranian kabab", "Kabob", "Burrah", "Kabaab", "Bihari kebab", "Chapli kabab", "Sheesh kebab", "Steam kebab", "Shish kabob", "Shish-kabob", "Kebab", "Galouti", "Kebap", "Chapli Kabab", "Galouti Kebab", "Kebab restaurant", "shish kebob", "kebab kenjeh \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647", "kebob", "chapli kabab", "shish kabob", "kakori kebab", "kebab", "burrah", "steam kebab", "sultan s feast", "bihari kebab", "galouti kebab", "kababs", "kabab bakhtiari", "iranian kabab", "kabab", "kebabs", "sheesh kebab", "chapli kebab", "chenjeh kebab", "testi kebab", "kebap", "shish kebab", "kabob", "kalmi kebab", "kalmi", "testi", "shishkebab", "kebab restaurant", "burrah kebab", "galouti", "qabab", "chelow kebab", "shishkabob", "kabaab"], ["Ccigarette", "Cigarrette", "Cigarette butts", "Cigaretes", "Cciggarete", "European cigarettes", "Full flavor (cigarette type)", "Sickarette", "Full flavored cigarettes", "Ciggie", "Cigarette end", "Cigarete", "Cigerette", "Ciggy", "100mm cigarette", "Cigarette", "Fag (cigarette)", "Full Flavor (cigarette type)", "Cigarette tube", "Lung rocket", "Cigarrete", "Cigaret", "Cig", "Coffin Nail", "Cigarette litter", "Smokes", "Cigarettes", "Cancer stick", "Cigs", "Cancer Stick", "Cigarette ash", "Loosey", "Ciggarette", "Tobacco cigarette", "Cigerettes", "Dog end", "Cigarette butt", "ciggy", "loosey", "cigarrete", "cigarettes", "cigarette litter", "lung rocket", "ccigarette", "smokes", "cigerette", "ciggarette", "ciggie", "fag cigarette", "cigs", "full flavored cigarettes", "cigarete", "cigaretes", "european cigarettes", "dog end", "cigarette", "cigarette tube", "cigarette butts", "cigerettes", "cigarette butt", "100mm cigarette", "cigaret", "coffin nail", "cigarette ash", "cigarette end", "sickarette", "tobacco cigarette", "cciggarete", "full flavor cigarette type", "cig", "cigarrette", "cancer stick"], ["Domestic Hedgehog", "Hedgepig", "Erinaceinae", "Hedge hog", "Hedge Hog", "Hedgehogs", "Hedgehog", "hedgepig", "domestic hedgehog", "hedgehogs", "erinaceinae", "hedge hog", "hedgehog"], ["Sir Edward Heath", "Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath II", "Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath (1974\u20131975)", "Edward Heath", "Edward Richard George Heath", "Ted Heath", "Edward R.

Her favorite tale was about a French painter named Paul Gauguin, who had once lived and worked on their very shores, capturing the vibrant colors and spirit of the island on his canvas. Inspired by these stories, Coco dreamed of exploring the world and uncovering its many secrets.\n\nOne day, while rummaging through her grandfather's old chest, Coco stumbled upon a dusty book titled \"Now We Are Six\" by A.A. Milne. Intrigued, she opened it and found a hidden note inside. It was a list of questions, each leading to a different part of the world. The first question asked about Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s only UK number one hit single, which she knew was \"The Sound of Silence.\" This was her first clue.\n\nDetermined to solve the mystery, Coco set off on her journey. Her first stop was Los Angeles, where she learned about the 1975 film \"Shampoo\" and its star, Warren Beatty, who played the charismatic hairdresser George Roundy. From there, she traveled to England, where she discovered that a snooker table starts with 22 balls and that in betting, odds of 3 to 1 are known as a 'Carpet.'\n\nHer journey then took her to Spain, where she delved into the world of bullfighting, central to Ernest Hemingway's non-fiction book \"Death in the Afternoon.\" As she explored the rich culture, she felt a connection to the bravery and artistry of the matadors.\n\nIn Jamaica, Coco learned about the infamous James Bond villain, Dr. Julius No, and his nefarious plans.

Her favorite tale was about a French painter named Paul Gauguin, who had once lived and worked on their very shores, capturing the vibrant colors and spirit of the island on his canvas. Inspired by these stories, Coco dreamed of exploring the world and uncovering its many secrets.\n\nOne day, while rummaging through her grandfather's old chest, Coco stumbled upon a dusty book titled \"Now We Are Six\" by A.A. Milne. Intrigued, she opened it and found a hidden note inside. It was a list of questions, each leading to a different part of the world. The first question asked about Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s only UK number one hit single, which she knew was \"The Sound of Silence.\" This was her first clue.\n\nDetermined to solve the mystery, Coco set off on her journey. Her first stop was Los Angeles, where she learned about the 1975 film \"Shampoo\" and its star, Warren Beatty, who played the charismatic hairdresser George Roundy. From there, she traveled to England, where she discovered that a snooker table starts with 22 balls and that in betting, odds of 3 to 1 are known as a 'Carpet.'\n\nHer journey then took her to Spain, where she delved into the world of bullfighting, central to Ernest Hemingway's non-fiction book \"Death in the Afternoon.\" As she explored the rich culture, she felt a connection to the bravery and artistry of the matadors.\n\nIn Jamaica, Coco learned about the infamous James Bond villain, Dr. Julius No, and his nefarious plans. Her adventure continued to England, where she discovered that Clement Attlee was the British Prime Minister between Winston Churchill\u2019s two terms in office. She also learned about Joe Mercer, who succeeded Alf Ramsey as England's caretaker football manager in 1974.\n\nAs Coco pieced together each clue, she realized that her journey was not just about solving a mystery but about discovering the interconnectedness of the world.

This year, young Hiccup was determined to win the coveted title of Dragon Master.\n\nAs the festival approached, Hiccup found himself in need of guidance. He turned to the village's wise elder, a man who was said to have the wisdom of Socrates, the Greek philosopher who famously lived inside a barrel. The elder, with a twinkle in his eye, handed Hiccup a book titled \"Amnesiac,\" a collection of tales and wisdom from the past, much like the 2001 album by Radiohead.\n\nHiccup spent his days training with his dragon, Toothless, by the tranquil tarn\u2014a small mountain lake that shimmered under the sun.

Al was captivated by the tales and decided to embark on his own adventure, inspired by the characters he read about.\n\nAs Al journeyed through the bog, he imagined himself as a secret agent, much like James Bond in \"From Russia with Love,\" the second film in the iconic series. He navigated the treacherous terrain with the precision of a Scrabble player eyeing a double-word score, of which there are 17 on a standard board.\n\nAlong the way, Al met a wise old beetle named Joseph Cyril Bamford, or JCB for short, who shared stories of his own adventures. JCB spoke of a majestic horse named Black Beauty, from the novel by Anna Sewell, and how it had inspired him to appreciate the beauty in all creatures, big and small.\n\nAs they traveled together, Al and JCB encountered a friendly snail named Hughie Green, who shared the same surname as the late British television host and the American singer Al Green. Hughie was on a quest to find the fictitious Walford East station, a place he had heard about from watching \"Eastenders.\" He was curious to see how it replaced the real Bromley-by-Bow station on the London Underground map.\n\nTheir journey took them through lush landscapes and bustling anthills, where they met a scholarly grasshopper named Malcolm Bradbury, who had written \"The History Man.\" Malcolm regaled them with tales of history and philosophy, enriching their journey with wisdom and laughter.\n\nTogether, Al, JCB, Hughie, and Malcolm discovered the wonders of their world, forging friendships and learning that adventure could be found in the most unexpected places. And so, in the spirit of exploration and camaraderie, they continued their journey, forever inspired by the stories that had brought them together."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["The World Bog Snorkelling Championships are held annually in which European country?", "The largest known volcano in our solar system is on which planet?", "Which Scottish physician and novelist created Dr Finlay?", "How many double-word score squares are there on a standard Scrabble board?", "What it the title of the second James Bond film, which opened in the UK in 1963?", "What were the names of the founder of British company JCB?", "In the Anna Sewell novel, what is Black Beauty?", "American singer Al, late British television host Hughie and British businessman Philip all share which surname?", "The fictitious station of Walford East, which features in the UK television series \u2018Eastenders\u2019, replaces which London Underground station on the tube map?", "Who wrote the 1975 novel \u2018The History Man\u2019?"], "answers": [["Welsh nation", "Climate of Wales", "Autonomous Province of Wales", "Cymru / wales", "Cyrmu", "Wales", "WALES", "Rain in Wales", "Welsh Nation", "Welsh Peninsula", "Wales, UK", "Etymology of Wales", "Cymru", "Wales, United Kingdom", "Pays de Galles", "Communications in Wales", "The Principality of Wales", "West of the Rhymney", "Wales, U.K.", "Cymru am byth", "Gymru", "Cymru / Wales", "Welsh mountains", "CYMRU", "principality of wales", "welsh mountains", "wales", "wales u k", "cyrmu", "etymology of wales", "communications in wales", "gymru", "cymru am byth", "autonomous province of wales", "welsh peninsula", "wales united kingdom", "pays de galles", "climate of wales", "cymru wales", "welsh nation", "rain in wales", "west of rhymney", "cymru", "wales uk"], ["Fourth planet", "Sol 4", "Mars surface features", "Mars", "Mars/Planet", "Hydrology of Mars", "Magnetosphere of Mars", "Marte (planet)", "Mars (planet)", "Sol-4", "2003 opposition of Mars", "4th planet", "Planet Mars", "Sun e", "Sol e", "Mars (Planet)", "Physical characteristics of Mars", "Mars opposition", "Sol IV", "Oblate Mars", "Opposition of Mars", "Mars orbit", "fourth planet", "mars", "oblate mars", "mars surface features", "4th planet", "marte planet", "2003 opposition of mars", "mars opposition", "hydrology of mars", "planet mars", "sol e", "opposition of mars", "sun e", "mars orbit", "physical characteristics of mars", "sol 4", "mars planet", "magnetosphere of mars", "sol iv"], ["Archibald Cronin", "A J Cronin", "A.J.

Joey, with his infectious charisma, reminded them of the legendary American singer and actor, Fred Astaire, who penned his life story in 'Steps in Time.'\"\n\nAs the story unfolded, Bolt introduced a comedic twist. \"One evening, while sharing tales of their adventures, Joey quoted the famous comedian Groucho Marx, saying, 'A man is only as old as the woman he feels.' The room erupted in laughter, their spirits lifted by the humor and camaraderie.\"\n\nBolt's tale took a more serious turn as he spoke of their aspirations. \"Inspired by the motto 'Be the best,' the men vowed to live their lives with honor and courage, much like the British Army. However, they were wary of superstitions, especially the belief that peacock feathers brought bad luck if brought into the house.\"\n\nFinally, Bolt concluded his story with a touch of royalty. \"In a grand finale, the men imagined themselves wearing the St. Edward's Crown, the official British coronation crown, as they took their final bow on stage, their journey a testament to friendship, adventure, and the pursuit of dreams.\"\n\nWith that, Bolt ended his tale, leaving his audience in awe of the seamless blend of history, humor, and heart."], "parsing_success_flag": [true],

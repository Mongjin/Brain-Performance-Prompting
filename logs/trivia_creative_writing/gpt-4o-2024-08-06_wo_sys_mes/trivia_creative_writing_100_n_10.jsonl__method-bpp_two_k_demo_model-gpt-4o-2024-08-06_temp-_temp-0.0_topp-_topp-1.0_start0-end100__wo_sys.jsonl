One day, he stumbled upon an old journal at a flea market, which hinted at a hidden treasure linked to the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. Intrigued, Mario set off on an adventure to piece together the clues.\n\nHis journey took him to a library, where he learned about Stansfield Turner, the former CIA director, and his secretive operations. As Mario delved deeper, he found himself humming 'On the Street Where You Live' from 'My Fair Lady,' a song that seemed to follow him everywhere.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Mario discovered a connection to the failed 'Bomb Plot' of 1944 against Adolf Hitler, realizing the journal's author had been part of the resistance. Inspired by the courage of the past, Mario pressed on.\n\nAlong the way, he met a fellow traveler who shared his love for 80s music, particularly Richard Marx's 'Hold On To The Nights.' Together, they journeyed to Monument Valley, where John Ford had filmed 'Stagecoach,' and marveled at the iconic landscapes.\n\nTheir path led them to a music festival, where the sounds of Pink Floyd filled the air, and Mario felt a deep connection to the era. As they traveled along Highway 61, Mario reflected on Bob Dylan's influence and the timelessness of his music.\n\nFinally, Mario's quest brought him to Romania, the only Eastern Bloc country to participate in the 1984 LA Olympics. Here, he uncovered the final piece of the puzzle, a reference to 'Wild Palms,' a 90s sci-fi series that held the key to the treasure's location.\n\nWith newfound friends and a deeper appreciation for history and music, Mario realized that the true treasure was the journey itself and the stories he uncovered along the way."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In what year's Olympics were electric timing devices and a public-address system used for the first time?", "Who was the director of the CIA from 1976-81?", "Which musical featured the song The Street Where You Live?", "\"Who was the target of the failed \"\"Bomb Plot\"\" of 1944?\"", "Who had an 80s No 1 hit with Hold On To The Nights?", "Who directed the classic 30s western Stagecoach?", "Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters were in which rock group?", "Which highway was Revisited in a classic 60s album by Bob Dylan?", "Which was the only eastern bloc country to participate in the 1984 LA Olympics?", "Which 90s sci fi series with James Belushi was based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip of the same name?"], "answers": [["In 1912, in Stockholm", "in 1912 in stockholm"], ["George Bush", "George bush", "Goerge Bush", "George W.

He heard tales of a distant land called Virginia, where a legendary musician named Gene Vincent was born. Intrigued, Simba decided to embark on an adventure to learn more about the world.\n\nOn his journey, Simba met a wise old crow named Brandon, who shared stories of a mysterious film called 'The Crow.' Brandon warned Simba about the dangers of chasing shadows and the importance of staying true to oneself.\n\nAs Simba traveled further, he stumbled upon a lively festival where the music of The Staple Singers filled the air with their hit 'Let's Do It Again.'

SpongeBob, however, wanted to be with his friends, so he invited Patrick and Sandy to join him.\n\nTheir first stop was the Bikini Bottom Art Museum, where they admired cartoons by the famous Osbert Lancaster. Inspired, SpongeBob tried his hand at drawing, but his doodles looked more like jellyfish than cartoons.\n\nNext, they visited the Bikini Bottom Sports Hall of Fame, where they learned about Chris Evert, the defending champion when Martina Navratilova first won Wimbledon singles. SpongeBob imagined himself as a tennis star, swinging his spatula like a racket.\n\nFeeling adventurous, they decided to travel to the Sky Train Rail bridge in Thailand, using Sandy's latest invention. Along the way, they learned about Jock Hutchison, the first US-born winner of golf's British Open, and imagined playing golf on the sandy beaches.\n\nTheir journey took them to the Famous Players Film Company, the original name of the Paramount Film Company. SpongeBob dreamed of starring in his own movie, with Patrick as his co-star.\n\nAs they continued their adventure, they stumbled upon a statue of Roald Amundsen, the first person after Scott to reach the South Pole overland. SpongeBob imagined himself as an explorer, braving the icy waters of the Arctic.\n\nBack in Bikini Bottom, they met Seymour Hersh, the journalist who first told the world about the My Lai massacre. Seymour shared stories of bravery and truth, inspiring SpongeBob to always stand up for what's right.\n\nTheir final stop was a fashion show featuring designs by Jasper Conran, Terence and Shirley Conran's dress designer son. SpongeBob and Patrick strutted down the runway in their finest jellyfish costumes.\n\nTo celebrate their adventure, they enjoyed a refreshing Pepsi, just like the Spice Girls once promoted.

It all began when a baby stroller, designed by the ingenious Owen Finlay MacLaren, was found abandoned in the Gda\u0144sk Shipyard. This shipyard was known for its historical significance, being the birthplace of Solidarity.\n\nAs Batman investigated, he discovered a clue leading to a concert by Diana Ross, who shared a birthday with the impressionist Rich Little. The concert was a cover for a secret meeting of Gotham's elite, where they discussed the legendary home run record of Roger Maris, recently broken by Mark McGwire.\n\nThe plot thickened when Batman learned that the Philadelphia Phillies, winners of the first World Series of the 80s, were involved in a scheme to fix baseball games. To uncover the truth, Batman had to rely on his ally, Pete Sampras, who was seeded 12th when he won his first US Open, to infiltrate the sports world.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Batman faced off against a villain quoting Muhammad Ali, 'If I can't beat this bum take my name off the record books.' The showdown took place in Gothenburg, where Jonathan Edwards set his triple jump world record.\n\nWith the help of 'The Flash,' Michael Johnson, Batman raced against time to stop the villain's plan. In the end, Batman triumphed, just as Babe Ruth had blasted his last Major League home run for the Boston Braves, leaving a legacy of heroism and justice in Gotham."], "parsing_success_flag": [true],

She swam to the shores of Reims, a town known for its sparkling champagne and historical significance, where the German High Command once surrendered.\n\nIn her travels, she learned about the Treaty of Rome, a symbol of unity among European countries, and marveled at the bustling city of London, the first to open an underground railway system this century.\n\nAs she explored, she met a friendly artist named Ub Iwerks, who introduced her to the world of animation and the iconic character Mickey Mouse, whose voice was first brought to life by Disney himself.\n\nThe Little Mermaid also discovered a book by Julie Andrews, 'The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles,' which inspired her to dream even bigger. She imagined herself as a star like Barbara Eden, who shone brightly in the film based on the record Harper Valley PTA.\n\nWith each adventure, the Little Mermaid's heart grew fonder of the world above, and she realized that her dreams were as vast as the ocean itself."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which country was Earl Spencer's acrimonious divorce settlement heard?", "Which of the founders of United Artists had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet?", "In La Cage Aux Folles, what was La Cage Aux Folles?", "What percentage of the earth's surface is covered by Europe?", "Which European town gave its name to a Treaty which symbolizes closer economic links between European countries?", "Which home of champagne in France was also where the German High Command surrendered in WWII?", "Which was the first European city this century to open an underground railway system?", "Who first drew Mickey Mouse when ?Disney first supplied the voice?", "Which actress wrote the novel The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles?", "Who was the star of the film based on the record Harper Valley PTA by Jeannie C Riley?"], "answers": [["South africa", "South Africa's", "Southafrica", "Third Republic (South Africa)", "Republiek van Suid-Afrika", "Sou'frica", "Zuid Afrika", "Zuid-Afrika", "ISO 3166-1:ZA", "South-African", "S Africa", "Zuid Africa", "Mzansi", "Afrique du sud", "Zuidafrika", "Ningizimu Afrika", "Capital of South Africa", "Suid-Afrika", "South-Africa", "Rep. of SOUTH AFRICA", "The Republic of South Africa", "Suid Africa", "Azania/South Africa", "S Afr", "Saffa", "South African", "Seth efrika", "South Africa", "Soufrica", "Republic of south africa", "South Africa\u00e0", "The Beloved Country", "S.

The reef was a kaleidoscope of colors, with red, green, and blue hues dancing in the sunlight. One day, Nemo learned from his friend Dory that the reef was in trouble. Five-legged creatures, known as starfish, were causing damage to the coral.\n\nNemo decided to seek help from the wise turtle, Crush, who told him about a magical mineral called gypsum. This mineral could be used to create protective casts for the coral. With the help of his friends, Nemo gathered gypsum from the ocean floor.\n\nAs they worked, they noticed the water becoming murky due to eutrophication, a process where excess nutrients caused algae to bloom. Nemo remembered his father's advice about the importance of balance in nature, much like the balance of gases in the atmosphere, where oxygen plays a crucial role.\n\nWith determination, Nemo and his friends managed to clear the algae and protect the coral. As a reward, the star Sirius shone brightly in the night sky, guiding them back home. Nemo realized that just like the value of Pi, which is 3.142, life is a circle, and every action has a consequence.\n\nIn the end, the reef was safe, and Nemo learned the importance of teamwork and balance in nature.

She had received a mysterious letter, much like the one Jonah wrote to Annie in 'Sleepless in Seattle,' asking her to meet at the Empire State building on St. Valentine's Day. The letter was signed by someone named T'Pau, a name she vaguely remembered from an old song about Valentine.\n\nAs she pondered the meaning of the letter, she noticed the word 'of' repeated several times, a reminder of its commonality in written English. Her thoughts drifted to the arcade game Pac-Man, where ghosts like Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde chased the protagonist, much like the Capitol pursued her.\n\nKatniss recalled a story she once heard about a film called 'Blade Runner,' where Harrison Ford's character questioned the nature of reality, similar to her own struggles in the Games.

As she walked along the yellow brick road, she met a curious character named Ken Bates, who was known for buying the Emerald City football club for just one emerald coin. Ken was on his way to watch the Grand National, a famous horse race in Oz, where the legendary horses Peter Simple, Jack Horner, and Ben Nevis were competing.\n\nFurther down the road, Dorothy encountered a group of singing munchkins led by Katrina and the Waves, who had just won the Ozvision Song Contest with their hit 'Love Shine A Light.' They were celebrating their victory with a grand parade.\n\nAs Dorothy continued her journey, she stumbled upon a wise old elephant named Vincent, who was known for his long gestation of ideas, much like his 22-month gestation period. Vincent shared stories of a great artist from the land of the Dutch, Vincent Van Gogh, who painted with colors as vibrant as the fields of Oz.\n\nDorothy's next encounter was with a quirky inventor named James Cameron, who claimed to be the 'king of the world' after creating a flying machine that could soar above the Emerald City. He was joined by his trusty gerbil companion, Kevin, who was always ready for an adventure.\n\nFinally, Dorothy met a charming but mysterious man named Steve Bing, who was known for his whirlwind romance with the actress Glinda the Good Witch. Despite the rumors, Steve insisted he was not the father of Glinda's magical son, until a DNA spell revealed the truth.\n\nAs the sun set over Oz, Dorothy realized she had learned so much from her new friends. She watched as the final event of the decathlon, the 1500 meters, took place in the grand stadium of Oz, with athletes from all over the land competing for glory.\n\nWith a heart full of memories and

Hudson, named after the famous butler from Upstairs Downstairs, was the unofficial leader of the neighborhood pets. One day, Hudson gathered his friends, including a curious parrot named La Toya, who loved to mimic the voices of celebrities like La Toya Jackson.\n\nThe pets had a mission: to solve the mystery of the missing painting, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" which had vanished from the local museum. The painting, with its melting clocks, was a favorite of the pets, who often visited the museum during their nightly escapades.\n\nTheir investigation led them to a mysterious alley where they encountered a trio of mischievous raccoons, reminiscent of the escaped convicts from \"We're No Angels.\" The raccoons, led by a cunning one named Bogart, had seen a suspicious figure lurking around the museum.\n\nAs the pets delved deeper into the mystery, they discovered that the thief was none other than a notorious cat burglar named Phil, who had a reputation as infamous as Phil Spector. Phil had hidden the painting in a secret location known only to a select few.\n\nWith the help of a wise old owl named Richard, who had once played the role of King Arthur in a local theater production, the pets devised a plan to retrieve the painting. Richard's knowledge of the city's hidden paths, much like the corridors of Gordonstoun School, proved invaluable.\n\nTheir adventure took them to the grand estate of Bagshot Park, where they sought the assistance of the noble dogs, Edward and Sophie. These regal canines, much like their human counterparts, were known for their grace and wisdom.\n\nIn a thrilling climax, the pets confronted Phil at 10 Rillington Place, a location with a dark history. With teamwork and cleverness, they managed to outwit Phil and recover the painting, returning it to its rightful place in the museum.\n\nThe pets celebrated their victory with a grand feast, knowing that their secret lives had once again made the city a better place."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 6, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was the surname of the butler played by Gordon Jackson in Upstairs Downstairs?", "Which Jackson appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in January 2009?", "The 1955 comedy movie We're No Angels centred on three escaped convicts.

Red, the leader, was munching on a bowl of Frosted Flakes, exclaiming, 'They're great!' when suddenly, the mischievous pigs launched an attack to steal their precious eggs.\n\nAs the birds gathered to plan their defense, Chuck, the speedy yellow bird, recalled a strategy from a Wimbledon match. 'Remember how Boris Becker was runner-up three times? We need to be persistent like him!' he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Matilda, the nurturing bird, inspired the team with tales of Steffi Graf's seven Wimbledon victories, encouraging them to aim for success.\n\nIn the midst of their planning, Bomb, the explosive bird, accidentally tuned into an old episode of Top of the Pops, where Jocky Wilson was mistakenly portrayed. This gave him a brilliant idea for a distraction.\n\nThe birds decided to dress up as characters from 'The Tenth Planet,' introducing the Cybermen to confuse the pigs. Red, channeling his inner Doctor, took on the role of the tenth Doctor, played by David Tennant.\n\nAs the battle ensued, the birds discovered twenty Rings of Power hidden in the pigs' lair, which they used to enhance their abilities. The island turned a shade of heliotrope as the rings glowed with power.\n\nIn a surprising twist, Michelle Ryan, who had left Eastenders for Hollywood, appeared as the Bionic Woman to assist the birds. Her presence added an unexpected flair to the showdown.\n\nFinally, Rodney Trotter, who shared his middle name with Charlton, arrived with reinforcements from the London football club, tipping the scales in favor of the birds.\n\nWith teamwork and determination, the Angry Birds triumphed, saving their eggs and restoring peace to Bird Island. And as they celebrated, Red couldn't help but shout, 'They're great!' once more."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["If you heard the catchphrase \"They're great\" what would expect to be advertised?", "How many times was Boris Becker runner-up in the Men's Singles at Wimbledon?", "How many times did Steffi Graf win the Ladies Singles at Wimbledon?", "Who did Top of the Pops mistakenly portray in a Dexys Midnight Runners song?", "What story introduced the Cybermen?", "Who played the tenth Doctor?", "How many Rings of Power were there, in total?", "Which common colour can also be known as heliotrope?", "Which actress left Eastenders for Hollywood only to flop as The Bionic Woman?", "In Only Fools And Horses, Rodney Trotter shares his middle name with which London football club?"], "answers": [["Frosted Rice", "Tiger Power", "Frosted Flakes", "Cinnamon Krunchers", "Kellog's Frosted Flakes", "Zucaritas", "Whole Grain Tiger Power", "They're gonna taste great", "Tony's Cinnamon Krunchers", "Frosted Flakes of Corn", "Cocoa Frosted Flakes", "Kellogg's Frosted Flakes", "List of Frosted Flakes Products", "Kellogg's Frosties", "Sugar Frosted Flakes", "Frosties", "frosted flakes of corn", "they re gonna taste great", "cocoa frosted flakes", "tony s cinnamon krunchers", "kellog s frosted flakes", "kellogg s frosties", "tiger power", "sugar frosted flakes", "frosted rice", "cinnamon krunchers", "whole grain tiger power", "zucaritas", "frosted flakes", "kellogg s frosted flakes", "list of frosted flakes products", "frosties"], ["four", "4", "four", "4"], ["seven", "7", "seven", "7"], ["Jocky Wilson", "Jockey Wilson", "Jockie Wilson", "jockie wilson", "jocky wilson", "jockey wilson"], ["The Tenth Planet", "Dr Who \u2013 Music from the Tenth Planet", "Dr Who - Music from the Tenth Planet", "The Tenth Planet (Doctor Who)", "dr who music from tenth planet", "tenth planet doctor who", "tenth planet", "dr who \u2013 music from tenth planet"], ["David Tennent", "THEDavidTennant", "Not Stalking David Tennant", "David tennant", "David tenant", "David Tennant", "David Tenant", "david tennant", "not stalking david tennant", "david tennent", "david tenant", "thedavidtennant"], ["twenty", "20", "20", "twenty"], ["Purplingly", "Purple (colour)", "Purplishness", "Purple", "Purpled", "Purplest", "Northwestern Purple (color)", "Heather Purple", "Words which rhyme with Purple", "Purpleish", "Purple flowers", "Purplishly", "Purpling", "Purple (color)", "List of terms associated with the color purple", "Purple vs. violet", "Purples", "Purpler", "northwestern purple color", "words which rhyme with purple", "purpleish", "purplishness", "purple flowers", "purpler", "purplingly", "purples", "purplishly", "purple", "purple color", "purple colour", "purple vs violet", "purpled", "list of terms associated with color purple", "heather purple", "purpling", "purplest"], ["Michelle Ryan", "Michelle Ryans", "Michele ryan", "michele ryan", "michelle ryan", "michelle ryans"], ["Charlton (disambiguation)", "Charlton", "charlton", "charlton disambiguation"]], "question_ids": ["qz_3878", "qz_3895", "qz_3898", "qz_3911", "qz_3920", "qz_3923", "qz_3927", "qz_3968", "qz_3971", "qz_3995"], "topic": "Angry Birds Movie"}}

Ms. Frizzle, with her usual flair, announced their first stop: November 1, 1956, where they witnessed Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd installing the first parking meter in London. The students marveled at how such a simple device could change city life.\n\nNext, the bus zoomed to the early 1970s, where they encountered the quirky Bond Bug, a bright orange, three-wheeled car that seemed to defy gravity with its unique design. The students giggled as they imagined driving one themselves.\n\nTheir adventure continued as they sailed aboard Jacques Cousteau's Calypso, exploring the wonders of the ocean. The students learned about marine life and the importance of oceanographic research.\n\nSuddenly, the bus transformed into Marine One, soaring through the skies as they learned about the helicopter's role in transporting the President of the United States. The students felt like VIPs as they flew over Washington, D.C.\n\nThe bus then took them back in time to Hever Castle in Kent, where they met Anne Boleyn, the enigmatic queen consort of England. The students were fascinated by her story and the history of the Tudor era.\n\nTheir next stop was New York City, the capital of the United States from 1785 to 1790. The students explored the bustling streets and imagined life in the early days of the nation.\n\nThe bus then whisked them away to the fictional world of St. Trinian's, where they encountered the mischievous students of the boarding school. The students laughed at the antics and chaos that ensued.\n\nAs they traveled through time, they met Martin Clunes, who portrayed the beloved character Mr. Chips in the 2002 TV adaptation. The students were inspired by his dedication to teaching and learning.\n\nThroughout their journey, Ms. Frizzle reminded them of the importance of education, echoing the words of George W. Bush: 'Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?' The students pondered the significance of this question.\n\nFinally, as their adventure came to an end, Ms. Frizzle playfully asked, 'Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?' The students laughed, knowing that their journey on the Magic School Bus was one they would never forget."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following that year's April Budget, Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, who later became Lord Mayor of London, bought the first what on 1 November 1956?", "Produced between 1970 and 1974, what is a Bond Bug?", "What was Jacques Cousteau's mobile oceonagraphic laboratory.", "What is the name of the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States", "Which queen consort of England is associated with Hever Castle in Kent?", "What was the capital of the United States between 1785 and 1790??", "Which fictional girls' boarding school was created by the cartoonist Ronald Searle", "Who played the character Mr Chips in the 2002 TV adaptation of Goodbye Mr Chips", "Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?", "Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?"], "answers": [["ERNIE", "Premium bond", "Premium bonds", "Premium Bond", "Premium Bonds", "Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment", "ernie", "premium bond", "premium bonds", "electronic random number indicator equipment"], ["Automotive vehicle", "Ottomobile", "Automobile", "Environmental impact of cars", "Self-rolling carriage", "\ud83d\ude97", "Motorcar", "\ud83d\ude98", "M1 vehicle", "Cardoor", "Motorization", "Automobil", "Automobiles", "Self-propelling carriage", "Passenger Vehicle", "Automobilism", "A car", "Car", "Motor car", "Passenger vehicles", "Motorisation", "Autos", "Automobles", "The Automobile", "Environmental impact of automobiles", "Motor-car", "Motor Car", "Car Automobile", "Cars", "Passenger vehicle", "automobilism", "automobil", "cars", "passenger vehicles", "autos", "environmental impact of automobiles", "automobile", "motorization", "\ud83d\ude97", "motor car", "automobiles", "\ud83d\ude98", "car", "automobles", "motorcar", "car automobile", "m1 vehicle", "self rolling carriage", "cardoor", "ottomobile", "passenger vehicle", "motorisation", "self propelling carriage", "automotive vehicle", "environmental impact of cars"], ["Calypso", "Callypso", "Calipso", "Calypsos", "Kalypso", "Calypso (disambiguation)", "kalypso", "callypso", "calypso", "calipso", "calypso disambiguation", "calypsos"], ["Marine Two", "Marine Corps One", "Marine One", "Marine I", "Marine one", "Marine 1", "Marine Corps 1", "Marine-One", "marine two", "marine corps one", "marine i", "marine one", "marine 1", "marine corps 1"], ["Anne Boylen", "Anne Bullen", "Anne boelyn", "Anne Boullant", "Ann Boleyn", "Anne Boleyn, 1st Marchioness of Pembroke", "Anne Boelyn", "Ann Bullen", "Anne Boleyn", "Anna Bollina", "Queen Anne Boleyn", "Anne Bolyn", "Anne boleyn", "Anne bolyn", "anne bullen", "anne boylen", "anne boleyn 1st marchioness of pembroke", "anna bollina", "anne bolyn", "ann bullen", "anne boullant", "queen anne boleyn", "ann boleyn", "anne boleyn", "anne boelyn"], ["New Yourk State", "State of N.Y.", "US-NY", "N Y", "The state of NY", "NewYork", "NYS", "Neo York", "NY state", "Nova York", "State of new york", "Ny", "New york", "Nueva York (estado)", "N Y state", "New York (state)", "U.S. state of New York", "New York state", "New York, U.S.", "State New York", "N\u00fdja-J\u00f3rv\u00edk", "Newyork", "NEW YORK", "State of N.

As they sailed, Chuckie, the navigator, pointed out a strange map with the letters 'MIX' scribbled on it. 'What does it mean?' he wondered aloud.\n\nSuddenly, they heard the enchanting tunes of 'The Moody Blues' playing in the distance. 'It's a sign!' exclaimed Phil, as they followed the music to a hidden island. There, they met a wise old man named Otto, who was known as the Iron Chancellor. 'Welcome, young adventurers,' Otto greeted them, 'I have a riddle for you.'\n\nBefore they could answer, a raven swooped down, dropping a feather at their feet. 'It's a clue!' said Lil, picking it up. Just then, a drummer named Pete appeared, tapping a lively beat. 'I was once part of a famous band,' he said with a wink.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they stumbled upon a grand castle where Kaiser Wilhelm II was hosting a tea party. 'Join us!' he invited, 'But beware of Julius Caesar's ghost, who roams these halls whispering, \"Et Tu Brute.\"'\n\nIn the castle's library, they found a dusty old book about 'Hamlet,' with pictures of Mel Gibson and Kenneth Branagh on the cover. 'Let's act it out!' suggested Angelica, always ready for drama.\n\nFinally, they discovered a secret room filled with old movie reels. 'Look, it's Charlie Chaplin!'

His adventure continued to The Cavern Club, where the Beatles once played, and he felt the spirit of music and history come alive.\n\nAlong the way, Reggie met a wise panther named Bagheera, who guided him through the artistic wonders of Salvador Dal\u00ed, including the Chupa Chups logo. Bagheera shared tales of Harold Wilson's unexpected appearance on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special, adding a touch of humor to their journey.\n\nIn the end, Reggie realized that the lightest metal, lithium, was not just a scientific fact but a metaphor for the lightness of being and the joy of discovery.

They painted their favorite pine trees\u2014Yellow-pine, Uinta, and Lodgepole\u2014with these colors, creating a magical forest.\n\nMeanwhile, Po found a mysterious book written by a former RAF pilot named Arthur Hailey. The book, titled 'Airport,' was filled with tales of adventure. Inspired, the Teletubbies decided to have their own adventure. They imagined themselves as a football team, just like Italy, who won the 1938 FIFA World Cup by beating Hungary 4-2.\n\nAs they played, they heard a voice calling out 'Charlie' from the NATO phonetic alphabet. It was their friend, a falcon named Charlie, practicing falconry with a creance. Charlie joined their game, adding to the fun.\n\nLater, they watched a movie starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne from 'Scooby-Doo.' Inspired by the mystery, they decided to solve a puzzle involving Mr. Bean's Mini, which had a secret compartment filled with seat belts from 1983, the year it became compulsory to wear them in the UK.\n\nFinally, they gathered around to hear a story about Boutros Ghali, the Prime Minister of Egypt who was assassinated in 1910. The Teletubbies learned about history and the importance of peace.\n\nAnd so, the Teletubbies ended their day with laughter and learning, ready for more adventures tomorrow."], "parsing_success_flag":

Rainbow Brite giggled at the sight, remembering the whimsical tales of Wonderland.\n\nContinuing her journey, she met a wise old owl who spoke of a mysterious series called 'The X-Files,' known in distant lands as 'Mucke.' Intrigued, Rainbow Brite promised to explore these tales one day.\n\nHer adventure led her to a quaint village where the air was filled with the sweet scent of cherries. The villagers were celebrating with a special drink called 'Kriek,' a cherry-flavored delight.\n\nIn the heart of the village stood the Jewry Wall Museum, a place filled with ancient wonders. Rainbow Brite marveled at the history and stories it held, especially those of a traveler named Bill Bryson, who once said, 'I came from Des Moines. Somebody had to.'\n\nAs the sun began to set, Rainbow Brite found herself in a grand hall, where a portrait of Al Pacino, the legendary leader of the Corleone family, hung on the wall. She admired his strength and leadership.\n\nNearby, a gentle stream flowed, home to beautiful trout\u2014Brown, American Rainbow, and Cutthroat. Rainbow Brite watched them dance in the water, their colors shimmering in the fading light.\n\nFinally, she reached the Enchanted Forest's heart, where the magical slipper lay.

Inspired by the spirit of teamwork, they continued their journey, singing songs from the film 'Barbarella,' which they learned was the inspiration for the band Duran Duran.\n\nTheir travels took them to a concert where they met Terry Hall, the lead singer of 'The Specials,' who shared stories of his musical adventures. Along the way, they encountered a mysterious figure known as Colonel Tom Parker, who regaled them with tales of managing the legendary Elvis Presley.\n\nCrossing the Andes on the Transandine Railway, the kids marveled at the breathtaking landscapes between Argentina and Chile. In a quaint village, they met a friendly corporal, who explained that in the British military, a bombardier is equivalent to his rank.\n\nTheir journey led them to an opera house where they learned about Puccini's unfinished masterpiece, 'Turandot.' As they explored the world of music and art, they stumbled upon a magical forest where characters from 'The Jungle Book,' including King Louie, Akela, and Ziggy, danced and sang.\n\nFinally, the Cabbage Patch Kids found themselves in a cozy library, where they discovered the play 'The Iceman Cometh' by Eugene O'Neill.

Bladers from around the world gathered, each hoping to claim the coveted Moondog Coronation Ball trophy. Among them was a young blader named Arthur, named after the legendary author Arthur C. Clarke, who was known for his strategic mind and innovative techniques.\n\nArthur's Beyblade, 'Lupine Phi,' was inspired by the fierce spirit of the wolf and the wisdom of the Greek letter Phi. His journey began at the historic Worcester Cathedral, where he discovered an ancient scroll detailing the secrets of Beyblade mastery, said to be written by a mysterious figure known only as T.E. Lawrence.\n\nAs the tournament progressed, Arthur faced formidable opponents, including a blader from Scotland, whose Beyblade, 'Daisy,' was as resilient as the flower it was named after. The competition was fierce, but Arthur's determination and the guidance of his mentor, Stanley Baldwin, helped him advance to the finals.\n\nIn the final match, Arthur faced the reigning champion, a blader known as 'The Lord Advocate,' whose skills were unmatched. The battle was intense, with both bladers pushing their Beyblades to the limit. In a thrilling climax, Arthur's 'Lupine Phi' unleashed a powerful attack, securing victory and earning him the title of champion.\n\nAs the crowd cheered, Arthur realized that his journey was just beginning. With the spirit of adventure and the wisdom of the past guiding him, he looked forward to the challenges ahead, ready to make his mark in the world of Beyblade."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which is the only nation to have won at least one medal in every Summer Olympic Games?", "In which English cathedral is the tomb of King John?", "Lupine relates to which animal?", "what is the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet?", "What was the name of the concert held at the Cleveland Arena, Ohio, on 21st March 1952, said to be the world\u2019s first major rock & roll concert?", "Who wrote the 1968 novel \u20182001: A Space Odyssey\u2019?", "The Lord Advocate is the chief law officer in which European country?", "Who was the only British Prime Minister to hold office during the reign of King Edward VIII?", "\u2018Bellis perennis\u2019 is the Latin name for which flower?", "Who wrote the novel \u2018Seven Pillars of Wisdom\u2019?"], "answers": [["Great\u2013Britain", "England, Scotland and Wales", "England, Wales and Scotland", "Great Britain", "Gt.

Her journey led her to a mysterious island where she met a wise old tailor named Hardy Amies, who crafted beautiful garments for the islanders. Hardy told Moana about a legendary dragon named Idris, who lived atop the island's highest peak.\n\nIntrigued, Moana decided to find Idris. Along the way, she encountered a playful group of ferrets, known as a 'business,' who guided her through the dense forest. As she climbed higher, she met a friendly penguin named Bullseye, who offered to show her the way.\n\nReaching the peak, Moana found Idris, who was guarding a treasure: a magical circle line that connected all the realms of the island. Idris explained that the line was like the Circle Line of the London Underground, interconnecting every part of the island.\n\nMoana learned that the treasure was protected by a fierce guardian, Colonel Winter, who resembled a character from 'The Last Castle.' With the help of her new friends, Moana devised a plan to outsmart Colonel Winter and secure the treasure.\n\nIn the end, Moana returned to her village with the magical circle line, which brought prosperity and joy to her people. As a token of gratitude, the villagers gifted her a pair of beautifully crafted jeans, reminiscent of the styles in 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'\n\nMoana's adventure was a tale of courage, friendship, and discovery, where even a doe, a female gerbil she met along the way, played a part in her success."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which British fashion designer was commissioned by Stanley Kubrick to design the costumes for the film \u20182001: A Space Odyssey\u2019?", "In the Charles Dickens novel \u2018Oliver Twist\u2019 what is the name of Bill Sykes dog?", "Which line on the London Undergound rail system is the only line which interconnects with every other line?", "James Gandolfini plays the sadistic military prison commandant Colonel Winter in which 2001 film starring Robert Redford?", "What is a female gerbil called?", "In the children\u2019s television series \u2018Ivor the Engine\u2019 what is the name of the dragon?", "What is a group of ferrets called?", "Gentoo, Adelie and Macaroni are all species of which bird?", "In fashion Straight Cut, Boot Cut and Skinny are all types of what?", "Phillip Schofield, Jason Donovan and Donny Osmond have all played the starring role in which stage musical?"], "answers": [["Hardy Amies", "Sir Hardy Amies", "Edwin Hardy Amies", "hardy amies", "sir hardy amies", "edwin hardy amies"], ["Bulls eye", "Bulls Eye", "Bullseye (disambiguation)", "Bullseyes", "Bullseye", "Bullseye (game show)", "bulls eye", "bullseye disambiguation", "bullseyes", "bullseye", "bullseye game show"], ["Jubilee line", "Fleet Line", "Jubilee Line", "Fleet line", "jubilee line", "fleet line"], ["The Last Castle", "Last Castle", "last castle"], ["DOE", "Doe (disambiguation)", "Doe", "DoE", "doe disambiguation", "doe"], ["Idris", "Idris (disambiguation)", "\u0130dris", "idris", "idris disambiguation", "i\u0307dris"], ["The business", "The Business (disambiguation)", "A business", "The Business", "business", "business disambiguation"], ["Penquins", "Ptilopteri", "Sphenisciformes", "Penguine", "\ud83d\udc27", "Sphenisiformes", "Spheniscinae", "Pengiuns", "Behavior patterns of adult penguins", "Penguines", "Spheniscid\u00e6", "Spheniscidae", "Penguins", "Speniscidiformes", "A penguin", "Penquin", "Penguin eggs", "Impennes", "Isabelline penguin", "Penguin", "\ud83d\udc27", "penguin eggs", "behavior patterns of adult penguins", "spheniscidae", "penguins", "isabelline penguin", "spheniscinae", "penguines", "sphenisciformes", "penguin", "penguine", "spheniscid\u00e6", "penquins", "penquin", "sphenisiformes", "ptilopteri", "pengiuns", "impennes", "speniscidiformes"], ["Riveted jeans", "Blue-jeans", "Jeans trousers", "Jeans pant", "Blue Jeans", "Straight jeans", "Blue jeans", "Jeans", "Straight leg jeans", "Blue jean insulation", "\ud83d\udc56", "Jean cuts", "Destroyed jeans", "Bluejeans", "blue jean insulation", "riveted jeans", "straight leg jeans", "\ud83d\udc56", "jean cuts", "bluejeans", "blue jeans", "jeans trousers", "jeans pant", "straight jeans", "jeans", "destroyed jeans"], ["Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph's Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph And The Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat", "Joseph & the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat", "Joseph and the Amazing Techicolor Dreamcoat", "Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat", "Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the amazing technicolour dreamcoat", "Jatd", "jatd", "joseph and technicolor dreamcoat", "joseph and amazing technicolour dreamcoat", "dreamcoat", "amazing technicolor dreamcoat", "technicolor dreamcoat", "joseph s amazing technicolor dreamcoat", "joseph and amazing techicolor dreamcoat", "joseph and amazing technicolor dreamcoat", "joseph amazing technicolor dreamcoat"]], "question_ids": ["qb_4229", "qb_4235", "qb_4284", "qb_4289", "qb_4301", "qb_4306", "qb_4325", "qb_4336", "qb_4368", "qb_4427"], "topic": "Moana"}}

Meanwhile, Gru's friend, a sports agent named Jerry Maguire, was busy negotiating contracts for the world's top athletes, including a few minions who had taken up sports.\n\nOne day, while listening to Oasis's debut album 'Definitely Maybe,' Gru was inspired to throw a grand party. He imagined the Queen from 'Sing a Song of Sixpence' attending, enjoying bread and honey in the parlour. To add a twist, Gru invited Carson Wells, the bounty hunter played by Woody Harrelson, to keep things interesting.\n\nThe party was a hit, with Clive, Ian, and Vivian Anderson providing entertainment. They shared stories of their adventures, much like the thrilling tale of 'All the President's Men,' which Gru had recently watched. The minions, ever curious, were fascinated by the shoji doors that separated the party rooms, sliding them back and forth with glee.\n\nAs the night went on, a rinkhals snake slithered into the party, causing a momentary panic. But Gru, ever the quick thinker, charmed the snake with his dance moves, turning it into the highlight of the evening.\n\nThe party ended with a toast to Washington DC, declared the capital of the USA in 1790, a nod to the minions' newfound love for history.

As he traveled, he stumbled upon a football match at Craven Cottage, where he learned about teamwork from the Fulham players.\n\nPo then met a wise old turtle who told him about the legendary number 10, worn by the great Pele, symbolizing excellence and leadership. Inspired, Po vowed to become a better leader for his friends.\n\nContinuing his journey, Po encountered the Olympic Games, where the motto \u2018Swifter, Higher, Stronger\u2019 reminded him to always strive for greatness. He also learned about the tale of Damocles, with a sword hanging by a single horse hair, teaching him about the balance of power and responsibility.\n\nIn March, during St Joseph\u2019s Day celebrations, Po met a kind police officer named Sharon Pogue, who shared stories of bravery and compassion. She reminded him of the importance of protecting his community.\n\nPo's final lesson came from the story of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods to give to humanity, symbolizing the gift of knowledge and innovation. Inspired, Po returned home, ready to share his newfound wisdom.\n\nBack in the Valley of Peace, Po recounted his adventures to his friends, including the tale of Victor Frankenstein, a reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition.

The man shared the secret to dragon training: patience and understanding.\n\nFinally, Leo returned to Draconia, where he successfully trained Amnesiac, earning the respect of his peers and proving that even the most challenging dragons could be tamed with the right knowledge and heart."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which band released a 2001 album entitled \u2018Amnesiac\u2019?", "Which drink is known as \u2018The Wine of Islam\u2019?", "Which Russian author died at Astapovo Railway Station in 1910 of pneumonia?", "In 2006, who was the first football player in World Cup history to win the \u2018Best Young Player Award\u2019?", "Which Greek philosopher was said to have lived inside a barrel?", "The village of Tightwad is in which US state?", "Gary, Jason, Mark and Howard are all members of which British band?", "How many US Presidents have been impeached?", "Which four letter word beginning with T is a small mountain lake?", "In the nursery rhyme \u2018As I Was Going To St Ives\u2019 I met a man with how many wives?"], "answers": [["Dead Air Space", "Manic Hedgehog Demo", "On a Friday", "Radiohead: An Illustrated Biography", "Radio-head", "Manic Hedgehog demo tape", "Follow Me Around", "Manic Hedgehog (album)", "Radiohead Messageboard", "Radiohead at ease", "Radio-Head", "Radio Head", "Towering Above The Rest", "RadioHead", "RHMB", "Scott Johnson (drum technician)", "Radio head", "Xurbia Xendless Limited", "Spooks (song)", "Radiohead style and songwriting", "Radiohead (band)", "On A Friday", "Radiohead", "dead air space", "radiohead messageboard", "on friday", "radio head", "xurbia xendless limited", "manic hedgehog album", "radiohead illustrated biography", "follow me around", "scott johnson drum technician", "towering above rest", "radiohead band", "spooks song", "radiohead style and songwriting", "radiohead at ease", "manic hedgehog demo tape", "radiohead", "manic hedgehog demo", "rhmb"], ["Kawha", "Ginseng coffee", "Cafe de Columbia", "Coffee (drink)", "Coffee brews", "Caff\u00e9", "Coffee Bags", "Health effect of coffee", "Brazilian coffee", "Gourmet coffee", "Kaffee", "Coffe", "Joe (coffee)", "Medical effects of coffee", "Gavaccino", "Cup of Joe", "Specialty coffees", "Coffee", "Effects of coffee", "Health and pharmacology of coffee", "Regular coffee", "Ginseng Coffee", "Specialty Coffees", "Coffee brewing method", "Health effects of coffee", "Coffee and health", "Roasted coffee", "joe coffee", "health effects of coffee", "specialty coffees", "brazilian coffee", "kaffee", "roasted coffee", "kawha", "coffe", "caff\u00e9", "ginseng coffee", "cup of joe", "health and pharmacology of coffee", "coffee bags", "coffee and health", "cafe de columbia", "gavaccino", "coffee brewing method", "health effect of coffee", "regular coffee", "coffee brews", "coffee", "coffee drink", "medical effects of coffee", "effects of coffee", "gourmet coffee"], ["Lyof Nikolaivitch Tolstoi", "Tolstoy", "Leo Nikolaievich Tolstoy", "Lev Nikola\u00efevitch Tolsto\u00ef", "Lev Nikolajevi\u010d Tolstoj", "Count Lev Tolstoy", "Lev Nikolajevic Tolstoj", "Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy", "Leo tolstoi", "Tolstoi", "LN Tolstoi", "Leo N.

He challenged them to a friendly duel, reminiscent of the 'Battle of the Ages' between George Foreman and Evander Holyfield.\n\nAs they explored further, they met a wise old parrot who shared the story of James Lind and his pioneering treatment of scurvy, reminding them of the importance of health and perseverance.\n\nIn the distance, they heard the echoes of a football match, with Kenneth Wolstenholme's voice narrating the thrilling game. It was a reminder of teamwork and the joy of shared experiences.\n\nTheir adventure took a musical turn when they stumbled upon a hidden cave where the song \"Born to Be Wild\" played, introducing them to the origins of heavy metal music.\n\nFinally, they met an elder named Neville Bonner, who shared tales of his journey as the first indigenous Australian in Parliament, inspiring Carl and

Their journey began on a sunny day in May, just as the city celebrated Labour Day.\n\nAs they drove through the scenic countryside, they reminisced about the legendary highwayman, Dick Turpin, imagining him galloping alongside their car on his stolen horse. Their first stop was Denmark, where they enjoyed a refreshing Wilbroe beer and indulged in local cheese, much to the delight of their turophile friend, who couldn't get enough of the creamy delicacies.\n\nThe friends continued their journey, listening to Nick Grimshaw's lively breakfast show on BBC Radio 1, which kept their spirits high. Along the way, they debated the best facial hair styles, with one friend sporting a stylish Soul Patch, while another preferred the classic Lincoln.\n\nTheir adventure took them to a quaint village where they stumbled upon a hurling match.

The clue led them to a grand race, reminiscent of the 2013 English Grand National, where a horse named Auroras Encore had once triumphed.\n\nAlong the way, they met a friendly monster named Dick Francis, who shared tales of his adventures, much like the late jockey's autobiography, 'The Sport of Queens.'\n\nTheir journey was filled with challenges, but they persevered, much like Zsa Zsa Gabor, who had married nine times, never giving up on love. Finally, they encountered a giraffe-like monster with the longest tail in Monstropolis, who guided them to the Golden Ferret.\n\nWith the Golden Ferret's help, Mike and Sulley returned to Monsters,

He had always been fascinated by trains, especially the legendary Mallard, the holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives. One day, while exploring an old railway station, he stumbled upon a mysterious lamp.\n\nAs he rubbed the lamp, a genie appeared, offering to grant him three wishes. Aladdin, being a curious soul, first wished to overcome his fear of nosebleeds, known as Epistaxiophobia, which had plagued him since childhood. With a wave of the genie's hand, his fear vanished.\n\nFor his second wish, Aladdin asked for the wisdom of the ages. The genie granted him the knowledge of the great novel 'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,' allowing him to see the world through a new lens.\n\nFinally, for his third wish, Aladdin desired to visit the tallest building in the world. The genie transported him to the top of the Sears Tower, where he marveled at the view.\n\nDuring his adventures, Aladdin befriended a group of cod, known as a Lap, who guided him to a hidden boutique named SEX, once run by the iconic Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood. There, he discovered a rare edition of Stephen King's 'Carrie,' which he gifted to his friend Leroy, who shared the middle name with the famous actor Samuel L Jackson.\n\nAs Aladdin's journey continued, he learned of the infamous Great Train Robbery, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, and the tale of Philippa of Hainault, the beloved wife of Edward III. These stories inspired him to live a life full of adventure and wonder.\n\nAnd so, Aladdin's modern tale unfolded, filled with magic, history, and the thrill of discovery."], "parsing_success_flag":

Here's a draft of the story:\n\nOnce upon a time, in the bustling city of Las Vegas, there was a curious dog named Bolt. Bolt had always been fascinated by the glitz and glamour of the city, but he was on a mission. He had heard tales of six legendary performers, much like the male strippers from 'The Full Monty,' who held the secret to eternal youth.\n\nHis journey began in Scotland, where he met a wise sheep named Dolly, who had been cloned in 1996. Dolly told him to seek out the autobiography 'Steps in Time' by Fred Astaire for guidance. With the book in paw, Bolt learned about the notorious highwaymen\u2014John Rann, John MacLaine, James Hind, and Claude Duval\u2014who once roamed the lands.\n\nAs Bolt continued his quest, he befriended a charming fellow named Joey Tribbiani, who shared tales of his adventures in the US television series 'Friends.' Together, they laughed at the witty words of Groucho Marx, who famously said, 'A man is only as old as the woman he feels.'\n\nTheir journey led them to the British Army, whose motto 'Be the best' inspired them to persevere.

His latest project was a book that explored pivotal moments and cultural milestones across the decades. His journey began with the 1932 Olympics, where he marveled at the introduction of electric timing devices and the public-address system, innovations that forever changed the face of sports.\n\nAs he delved deeper into his research, Mario found himself captivated by the enigmatic figure of Stansfield Turner, the director of the CIA from 1976-81. Turner's tenure was marked by significant geopolitical shifts, and Mario was determined to uncover the untold stories of that era.\n\nMusic was another thread in Mario's narrative. He often found himself humming 'On the Street Where You Live' from the musical 'My Fair Lady,' a song that resonated with his own longing for connection and belonging.\n\nMario's research took a darker turn as he explored the failed 'Bomb Plot' of 1944, a chilling reminder of the lengths to which people would go to change the course of history. The target, Adolf Hitler, was a figure of infamy, and Mario pondered the impact of such pivotal events.\n\nIn moments of reflection, Mario would listen to Richard Marx's 'Hold On To The Nights,' a song that reminded him of the fleeting nature of time and the importance of cherishing each moment.\n\nHis journey also led him to the world of cinema, where he admired the work of John Ford, the director of the classic 30s western 'Stagecoach.' The film's themes of courage and resilience resonated deeply with Mario.\n\nMusic continued to be a source of inspiration, and Mario often found solace in the sounds of Pink Floyd, the legendary rock group featuring David Gilmour and Roger Waters. Their music was a soundtrack to his explorations.\n\nHighway 61, immortalized in Bob Dylan's classic 60s album, became a symbol of Mario's journey\u2014a road that connected him to the past and guided him toward new discoveries.\n\nIn 1984, Mario was intrigued by Romania's participation in the LA Olympics, the only eastern bloc country to do so. It was a testament to the power of sports to transcend political boundaries.\n\nFinally, Mario's journey led him to the 90s sci-fi series 'Wild Palms,' based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip. The series, featuring James Belushi, explored themes of reality and illusion, mirroring Mario's own quest to uncover the truth behind history's veil.\n\nThrough his research, Mario not only uncovered the stories of the past but also found a deeper understanding of himself and his place in the world."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In what year's Olympics were electric timing devices and a public-address system used for the first time?", "Who was the director of the CIA from 1976-81?", "Which musical featured the song The Street Where You Live?", "\"Who was the target of the failed \"\"Bomb Plot\"\" of 1944?\"", "Who had an 80s No 1 hit with Hold On To The Nights?", "Who directed the classic 30s western Stagecoach?", "Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters were in which rock group?", "Which highway was Revisited in a classic 60s album by Bob Dylan?", "Which was the only eastern bloc country to participate in the 1984 LA Olympics?", "Which 90s sci fi series with James Belushi was based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip of the same name?"], "answers": [["In 1912, in Stockholm", "in 1912 in stockholm"], ["George Bush", "George bush", "Goerge Bush", "George W.

She decided to take a leap of faith and attend a grand ball at the luxurious Chicken Ranch, a place known for its extravagant parties.\n\nAt the ball, Cinderella met a charming actor named James, who had recently won an Oscar for his role in 'The Philadelphia Story.' He was as captivating as Anthony Hopkins in 'Nixon,' and his presence was as commanding as Roger Corman's cameo in 'The Silence of the Lambs.'\n\nAs the night unfolded, Cinderella found herself in a conversation with a mysterious woman named Ingrid, who had won an Oscar for 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Ingrid shared tales of her travels, including a recent trip to Libya, where she visited the Benina International Airport.\n\nInspired by Ingrid's stories and the enchanting music, Cinderella felt a transformation within her, akin to the emotional journey of David Helfgott in 'Shine.' She realized that her dreams were within reach, and she could create her own destiny.\n\nWith newfound confidence, Cinderella danced the night away with James, knowing that her life was about to change forever. As the clock struck midnight, she left the ball, leaving behind a single glass slipper as a token of her magical evening.\n\nIn the days that followed, James searched for the mysterious woman who had captured his heart. When he finally found Cinderella, he knew she was the one. Together, they embarked on a new adventure, proving that with courage and determination, dreams really do come true.\n\nAnd so, Cinderella's story became a legend, inspiring others to pursue their own dreams, just as she had done.\n\n---\n\n**Superior Parietal Lobule:** \"Let's review the story to ensure all elements are included and the narrative flows smoothly.\"\n\n**Amygdala:** \"The story feels emotionally engaging and creatively incorporates all the answers.

Her heart was filled with a longing to explore the world beyond the sea. One day, she heard tales of a magical place called the United Kingdom, where grand stories of love and loss, like that of Earl Spencer, unfolded.\n\nDriven by her curiosity, Ariel swam to the surface and found herself near a bustling city called London. It was here that she marveled at the underground railway system, the first of its kind in Europe, and imagined the adventures it could take her on.\n\nHer journey led her to a vibrant nightclub known as La Cage Aux Folles, where she met a kindred spirit named Mary Pickford, a founder of United Artists. Mary shared stories of creativity and dreams, inspiring Ariel to pursue her own.\n\nAs Ariel continued her travels, she reached the historic town of Maastricht, a symbol of unity and cooperation among European countries. Here, she learned about the importance of coming together for a common cause.\n\nIn Reims, the home of champagne, Ariel discovered the power of peace and reconciliation, as it was the place where the German High Command surrendered in WWII. The spirit of hope filled her heart.\n\nAriel's adventures also brought her to the enchanting world of literature, where she met Julie Andrews, the talented actress and author of \"The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles.\" Julie's stories sparked Ariel's imagination and encouraged her to dream big.\n\nFinally, Ariel found herself in a quaint town where she encountered Barbara Eden, the star of the film based on the record \"Harper Valley PTA.\" Barbara's tales of resilience and courage resonated deeply with Ariel.\n\nWith each new experience, Ariel's heart swelled with knowledge and wonder. She realized that the world was vast and full of stories waiting to be discovered. And so, with a heart full of dreams and a spirit of adventure, the Little Mermaid returned to the sea, ready to share her newfound wisdom with her ocean family.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer: The story of the Little Mermaid's journey through the United Kingdom, London, La Cage Aux Folles, Maastricht, Reims, and encounters with Mary Pickford, Ub Iwerks, Julie Andrews, and Barbara Eden, capturing the essence of exploration, unity, creativity, and courage.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 954, "completion_tokens": 984, "total_tokens": 1938, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc", "prompt": "When faced with a task, begin by identifying the brain regions that will contribute to solving the task.

Intrigued, Simba decided to explore further.\n\nAs he wandered, he heard the soulful tunes of Phil Collins echoing through the trees, a reminder of the legendary music recorded on the Atlantic Records label. The melodies guided him to an ancient record player, where he found a collection of Chuck Berry's classics from the Chess Records era.\n\nSimba's journey took him to a bustling city named Pittsburgh, where he met a wise old lioness named Debbie Rowe. She shared tales of the past, including the famous words of Mae West: 'To err is human but it feels divine.' Inspired, Simba continued his quest.\n\nIn a nearby meadow, he encountered a singer named Bobby Vinton, who serenaded him with 'Roses Are Red,' a song that filled the air with nostalgia.

Gypsum, named after the common mineral used to make casts and chalk, shared tales of the ocean's wonders, including the bright star Sirius, as luminous as 23 Suns, and its companion, the Pup.\n\nGuided by the light of Sirius, Nemo and his friends ventured further, learning about the Earth's vastness, with a circumference of approximately 24,901 miles. Along the way, they discovered the importance of Oxygen, the second most common gas in the atmosphere, which kept their underwater world alive.\n\nTheir journey was filled with challenges, but they were buoyed by the lightness of Helium, the second lightest chemical element, which lifted their spirits. As they navigated the ocean's mysteries, they realized that their adventure was as infinite as the value of Pi, 3.142, a never-ending journey of discovery.\n\nFinally, with the help of Luteinizing

A mysterious villain had left a series of cryptic clues, each tied to a piece of history or trivia. The first clue was a billboard featuring Eva Herzagovia with the slogan 'Hello Boys,' leading them to a Wonderbra factory where the villain had planted a device.\n\nThe next clue was a Bingo card with the number 57 circled, hinting at Heinz varieties. This led them to a warehouse filled with ketchup bottles, where they found a hidden message from the villain.\n\nAs they pieced together the clues, they discovered a connection to Thierry Henry, the legendary Arsenal striker, and a plot to disrupt a major soccer match. The villain's plan was to use the chaos to construct a new Berlin Wall, echoing the era of John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe Avengers realized they had only nine moves, like a perfect game of darts, to stop the villain. Their journey took them to Manchester United's stadium, where they found a set of 28 dominoes arranged in a pattern that revealed the next location.\n\nIn a surprising twist, they learned that Benjy and Laska, the space-faring dogs, were part of a holographic projection used by the villain to distract them. The final clue led them to the Jubilee Line on the London Underground, the only line connecting all others, symbolizing the villain's plan to connect chaos across the city.\n\nIn the end, it was Tony Stark's fear of the dark, much like Thomas Edison's, that inspired him to create a light-based solution to disable the villain's devices. With teamwork and ingenuity, the Avengers saved the day once more.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer: The Avengers story incorporates all the trivia elements into a thrilling narrative where they solve a mystery and stop a villain's plan using clues related to Wonderbra, Heinz 57, Thierry Henry, John F. Kennedy, darts, Manchester United, dominoes, space dogs, the Jubilee Line, and Edison's fear of the dark.\"", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 959, "completion_tokens": 907, "total_tokens": 1866, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc", "prompt": "When faced with a task, begin by identifying the brain regions that will contribute to solving the task.

He guided them to the hidden valley where Nadia Com\u0103neci, a guardian with the grace of a gymnast, protected the sacred scrolls.\n\nIn the heart of the valley, they met Luigina Giavotti, a wise sage who, despite her youthful appearance of 11 years and 302 days, held the key to unlocking the mysteries of time. She revealed that only by solving the riddle of Nick Rowan, the enigmatic lawkeeper, could they proceed.\n\nTheir journey took a whimsical turn when they encountered Boris, a giant spider who, unlike his fearsome kin, was known for his love of music. He sang tales of Duff beer, a legendary brew favored by the jovial bard Homer of Simpson.\n\nAs they neared the end of their quest, the companions found themselves in the enchanted halls of Holiday Inn, where the haunting melody of 'White Christmas' echoed through the air. It was here that they met Will Young, a minstrel whose song 'All This Time' held the final clue to their quest.\n\nWith courage and camaraderie, Frodo and his friends completed their journey, each element of their adventure weaving together to form a tapestry of triumph and unity."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What word is given to a point in tennis which has to be replayed?", "How many episodes of Prisoner: Cell Block H were made?", "Who is the last English-born player to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon?", "In 1976, which gymnast scored 7 maximum scores of 10 as she won three gold medals, one silver and one bronze?", "In years and days, how old was Luigina Giavotti when she won a silver medal in gymnastics in 1928, and is still the youngest medal winner today?", "Which Eastenders actor has played the policeman Nick Rowan on TV?", "What type of animal was Boris, the subject of a song by The Who?", "Which brand of beer does Homer Simpson drink regularly?", "In which film was the song White Christmas first sung?", "Which Pop Idol had a number one hit in 2004 called All This Time?"], "answers": [["Let (disambiguation)", "Let", "LET", "LET (disambiguation)", "let disambiguation", "let"], ["692", "six hundred and ninety-two", "692", "six hundred and ninety two"], ["Fred Perry", "Fred J.

As she wandered, she stumbled upon a zebra named Stripes, who was racing through the fields with the grace of a seasoned jockey. Stripes told Alice tales of horse racing, reminiscent of the thrilling novels by Dick Francis.\n\nContinuing her journey, Alice came across a quaint little stand where a newspaper called The Sunday Post was being sold. The vendor, a cheerful character, entertained her with stories of the Broons and Oor Wullie, bringing a smile to her face.\n\nAs she walked further, the air was filled with the melody of 'Christmas Alphabet,' sung by a choir of woodland creatures. The song reminded Alice of festive times and the joy of family gatherings.\n\nIn a clearing, she met a wise old owl who spoke of Peter Shilton, a legendary footballer known for his remarkable achievements. The owl's tales were as captivating as the music of Paul McCartney, who, in this world, was known for holding a golden trumpet that played tunes of wonder.\n\nAlice's adventure took a turn when she encountered a band of merry musicians playing 'Sunny Afternoon' by The Kinks. Their music was infectious, and Alice couldn't help but dance along.\n\nHer journey led her to The Blind Beggar, a mysterious pub where stories of the Kray twins echoed in the air. Despite the eerie tales, the pub was a place of camaraderie and laughter.\n\nAs the sun set, Alice heard the enchanting theme of the Pink Panther, composed by the legendary Henry Mancini. The music guided her to a garden where she met Meg Ryan, a charming actress who shared tales of love and adventure, including her Valentine's Day wedding to Dennis Quaid.\n\nWith a heart full of stories and a mind brimming with wonder, Alice continued her journey through Wonderland, knowing that each encounter was a piece of a grander tale."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What type of animal is the star of the 2005 film Racing Stripes?", "Author Dick Francis is famous for writing novels based around which sport?", "Which Scottish newspaper features the Broons and Oor Wullie?", "Which Christmas song includes the line It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle'?", "Which British footballer has the most number of International caps?", "Who holds a trumpet on the album cover of Sgt.

The villagers welcomed Charlie with warm cider and stories of old.\n\nAs the train continued, Charlie found himself in a thrilling mystery, reminiscent of the movie 'Dressed to Kill,' where he had to solve a puzzle to unlock the next destination.\n\nIn a surprising twist, Charlie met a legendary footballer, Denis Law, who recounted his incredible feat of scoring six goals in a single match, only to face an unexpected defeat.\n\nThe journey took a scholarly turn when Charlie encountered the spirit of Adam Smith, who imparted wisdom from 'The Wealth Of Nations,' teaching Charlie the value of generosity and kindness.\n\nNext, the train passed through the ancient lands of the House of Dunkeld, where Charlie learned about the noble lineage of Macbeth and the lessons of history.\n\nAs the train neared the North Pole, Charlie faced a fiery challenge, much like Harry Potter's battle with the Hungarian Horntail. With courage and wit, he overcame the obstacle.\n\nIn a heartwarming encounter, Charlie met Buster Edwards, a reformed train robber, who shared tales of redemption and the importance of second chances.\n\nFinally, the train's journey was serenaded by the melodious voice of Tony Hadley from Spandau Ballet, filling the air with festive cheer.\n\nAs the Polar Express arrived at the North Pole, Charlie realized that the true magic of the journey lay in the friendships he had made and the lessons he had learned along the way."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which famous cowboy was created by George W.

The students marveled at the view from above, learning about the responsibilities of leadership.\n\nLanding in the lush gardens of Hever Castle, the class met Anne Boleyn, the queen consort of England, who shared tales of her life and times. The bus then whisked them away to New York City, the capital of the United States from 1785 to 1790, where they explored the early days of the nation.\n\nTheir journey took a humorous turn at St. Trinian's, the fictional girls' boarding school, where chaos and laughter reigned. The students even met Mr. Chips, played by Martin Clunes, who imparted wisdom with a twinkle in his eye.\n\nAs the day drew to a close, Ms. Frizzle reminded the class of the importance of learning, echoing the words of George W. Bush: 'Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?' With a final stop at a bustling city street, a cartoonish police officer humorously asked, 'Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?'\n\nWith hearts full of knowledge and laughter, the Magic School Bus returned home, leaving the students eager for their next adventure."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following that year's April Budget, Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, who later became Lord Mayor of London, bought the first what on 1 November 1956?", "Produced between 1970 and 1974, what is a Bond Bug?", "What was Jacques Cousteau's mobile oceonagraphic laboratory.", "What is the name of the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States", "Which queen consort of England is associated with Hever Castle in Kent?", "What was the capital of the United States between 1785 and 1790??", "Which fictional girls' boarding school was created by the cartoonist Ronald Searle", "Who played the character Mr Chips in the 2002 TV adaptation of Goodbye Mr Chips", "Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?", "Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?"], "answers": [["ERNIE", "Premium bond", "Premium bonds", "Premium Bond", "Premium Bonds", "Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment", "ernie", "premium bond", "premium bonds", "electronic random number indicator equipment"], ["Automotive vehicle", "Ottomobile", "Automobile", "Environmental impact of cars", "Self-rolling carriage", "\ud83d\ude97", "Motorcar", "\ud83d\ude98", "M1 vehicle", "Cardoor", "Motorization", "Automobil", "Automobiles", "Self-propelling carriage", "Passenger Vehicle", "Automobilism", "A car", "Car", "Motor car", "Passenger vehicles", "Motorisation", "Autos", "Automobles", "The Automobile", "Environmental impact of automobiles", "Motor-car", "Motor Car", "Car Automobile", "Cars", "Passenger vehicle", "automobilism", "automobil", "cars", "passenger vehicles", "autos", "environmental impact of automobiles", "automobile", "motorization", "\ud83d\ude97", "motor car", "automobiles", "\ud83d\ude98", "car", "automobles", "motorcar", "car automobile", "m1 vehicle", "self rolling carriage", "cardoor", "ottomobile", "passenger vehicle", "motorisation", "self propelling carriage", "automotive vehicle", "environmental impact of cars"], ["Calypso", "Callypso", "Calipso", "Calypsos", "Kalypso", "Calypso (disambiguation)", "kalypso", "callypso", "calypso", "calipso", "calypso disambiguation", "calypsos"], ["Marine Two", "Marine Corps One", "Marine One", "Marine I", "Marine one", "Marine 1", "Marine Corps 1", "Marine-One", "marine two", "marine corps one", "marine i", "marine one", "marine 1", "marine corps 1"], ["Anne Boylen", "Anne Bullen", "Anne boelyn", "Anne Boullant", "Ann Boleyn", "Anne Boleyn, 1st Marchioness of Pembroke", "Anne Boelyn", "Ann Bullen", "Anne Boleyn", "Anna Bollina", "Queen Anne Boleyn", "Anne Bolyn", "Anne boleyn", "Anne bolyn", "anne bullen", "anne boylen", "anne boleyn 1st marchioness of pembroke", "anna bollina", "anne bolyn", "ann bullen", "anne boullant", "queen anne boleyn", "ann boleyn", "anne boleyn", "anne boelyn"], ["New Yourk State", "State of N.Y.", "US-NY", "N Y", "The state of NY", "NewYork", "NYS", "Neo York", "NY state", "Nova York", "State of new york", "Ny", "New york", "Nueva York (estado)", "N Y state", "New York (state)", "U.S. state of New York", "New York state", "New York, U.S.", "State New York", "N\u00fdja-J\u00f3rv\u00edk", "Newyork", "NEW YORK", "State of N.

As he moved through the exhibits, he stumbled upon a peculiar display featuring a Bacardi rum bottle, its iconic bat symbol reminding him of the mysterious creatures of the night.\n\nIn a quiet corner, Rick found a rare edition of 'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold' by John le Carr\u00e9, a novel that spoke of espionage and intrigue, much like the political games Fidel Castro played when he banned Monopoly in Cuba. The museum's guide, a knowledgeable man named John, shared stories of the past, including the biblical account of the apostle John, the sole witness to the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nAs Rick continued his exploration, he imagined the dramatic scenes from 'I, Claudius,' where John Hurt portrayed the infamous Caligula, and he chuckled at the thought of a mouldwarp, or mole, burrowing through the museum's gardens, unseen yet ever-present.\n\nWith each step, Rick felt a deeper connection to the stories and histories that surrounded him, realizing that, much like the characters and events he

Their journey began on a bright Thursday morning, or 'Giovedi' as Rarity liked to say, adding a touch of Italian flair to their adventure.\n\nAs they trotted through the enchanted forest, they stumbled upon a grand virtual museum curated by none other than the famous fashion designer, Valentino. Inside, they discovered a mystical artifact that once belonged to Meta, the first wife of the mythical king Aegeus.\n\nTheir path led them to a charming village where they met a friendly Labrador Retriever named Marley, who guided them to a hidden cave. Inside, they found a map marked with four stars, reminiscent of the New Zealand flag, pointing the way to their next destination.\n\nAlong the way, Pinkie Pie couldn't help but giggle at the mention of scatology, the study of excrement, which she found both gross and fascinating. As they continued, they encountered a Bingo game where the number 31, 'Get up and run,' was the key to unlocking a secret passage.\n\nFinally, their journey brought them to the vibrant land of Argentina, where they learned about the legacy of Roberto M. Ortiz, who became President in 1938. With newfound knowledge and friendships, the ponies returned home, their hearts full of joy and adventure.\n\nAnd so, the ponies of Equestria learned that history and friendship are intertwined, and every adventure brings new stories to tell."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which British monarch founded the Yeomen of the Guard, originally as a royal bodyguard?", "Which member of the British royal family married on the 29th April 2011?", "Which Italian fashion designer launched the first virtual online museum in December 2011?", "In Greek mythology, who was the first wife of Aegeus?", "Which breed of dog is Marley in the 2008 film \u2018Marley and Me\u2019?", "\u2018Giovedi\u2019 is the Italian word for which day of the week?", "How many stars are on the national flag of New Zealand?", "Scatology is the scientific study of what?", "In the game of Bingo, \u2018Get up and run\u2019 represents which number?", "In February 1938, Roberto M.

He had been transported to a parallel universe where the rules of the game were intertwined with the history and culture of another world. This world was known as Barataria, reminiscent of the operetta 'The Gondoliers' by Gilbert and Sullivan, where the dueling arenas were as grand as the stages of old.\n\nYugi soon discovered that the inhabitants of this world followed a unique belief system, much like the Rastafarian religion, where Sufferers, Locksmen, and Dreads were not just followers but also powerful duelists. They believed in the power of the red stars, akin to those on the national flag of Syria, which symbolized their strength and unity.\n\nDuring his journey, Yugi encountered a young duelist named Louis, who claimed to be the great-grandson of a legendary duelist known as the Sun King, reminiscent of Louis XIV of France. Louis was afflicted with Duane Syndrome, which affected his eyes, but this did not deter his spirit. He had a fear, much like Taphephobia, of being buried alive in the shadows of defeat, yet he persevered.\n\nGuided by the wisdom of a druid named Getafix, from the village of Asterix, Yugi learned the secrets of this world. Getafix, with his vast knowledge, reminded Yugi of the importance of his roots, much like Margaret Thatcher's humble beginnings in Lincolnshire.\n\nAs Yugi prepared for the ultimate duel, he drew inspiration from the tales of Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, the athletes whose stories were immortalized in 'Chariots of Fire'. He realized that, like them, he must run his own race, directed by the spirit of determination akin to John Huston's direction of 'The Maltese Falcon'.\n\nWith newfound resolve, Yugi faced his final opponent, channeling the power of the red stars and the wisdom of the past. In a climactic battle, he emerged victorious, proving that the heart of the cards and the spirit of history were on his side."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count":

Her journey began when she discovered an ancient map hidden within the pages of a book designed by the legendary British fashion designer, Hardy Amies. The map promised to lead her to a mystical island where the legendary dragon, Idris, was said to reside.\n\nAs Moana set sail, she was accompanied by her loyal pet penguin, Macaroni, who was always eager for an adventure. Along the way, they encountered a peculiar group of ferrets, known as a business, who were traveling on a makeshift raft. The ferrets spoke of a wise old gerbil, a doe named Bullseye, who could guide them through the treacherous waters of the Circle Line, a mysterious current that interconnected with every other oceanic path.\n\nTheir journey was not without challenges. They faced the wrath of Colonel Winter, a fearsome figure who guarded the island with an iron fist, much like the character from 'The Last Castle.' But Moana's determination was unwavering. She donned her favorite pair of jeans\u2014straight cut, for ease of movement\u2014and pressed on.\n\nAs they neared the island, Moana recalled a tale from her childhood, a story of a colorful coat worn by a hero named Joseph. Inspired by this tale, she crafted a vibrant sail for her boat, reminiscent of the Technicolor Dreamcoat, to catch the wind and propel them forward.\n\nFinally, they reached the island, where Idris the dragon awaited. With courage and kindness, Moana befriended Idris, and together, they unlocked the secrets of the island, ensuring peace and prosperity for her people.\n\nAnd so, Moana's legend grew, a testament to her bravery and the power of friendship.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer: The story of Moana's adventure incorporates the answers to the questions, weaving them into a narrative that highlights her courage and the magic of her world.\"", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 979, "completion_tokens": 878, "total_tokens": 1857, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_9ee9e968ea", "prompt": "When faced with a task, begin by identifying the brain regions that will contribute to solving the task.

As he wandered through the bustling market, he met an elderly man named Lennard, who reminded him of Grandad from the UK series 'Only Fools and Horses.' Lennard shared tales of innovation, including the story of Edmund Cartwright, who designed the first power loom in 1784.\n\nNearby, a group of children played with a badminton shuttlecock, its 16 feathers fluttering in the breeze. Alex was reminded of the thrill of sports and thought of Ilie N\u0103stase, the tennis player known as \u2018Nasty.\u2019 As the sun set, Alex joined a local family for dinner, savoring a warm bowl of \u2018London Particular\u2019 pea soup.\n\nLater, as the festival lights twinkled, Alex overheard a conversation about the infamous Al Capone, known as \u2018Scarface,\u2019 and his notorious escapades. The night took a humorous turn when a friend joked about gymnogynomania, the urge to spy on people while they are naked, causing laughter to ripple through the crowd.\n\nAs the festival drew to a close, Alex met a fellow traveler named Theresa, who bore a striking resemblance to Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress who played Brad Pitt\u2019s wife in 'Seven.' Together, they watched the fireworks light up the sky, a perfect end to a day filled with unexpected connections and stories."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_k_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Fiji Day is celebrated in Fiji during which month of the year?", "Who played Grandad in the UK television series \u2018Only Fools and Horses\u2019?", "In 1784, who designed the first power loom?", "Which motorcycle company introduced the Jet Ski in 1972?", "How many feathers, traditionally, form the cone of a badminton shuttlecock?", "Which tennis player, born in 1946, was nicknamed \u2018Nasty\u2019?", "What was US gangster Al Capone\u2019s nickname?", "What type of food dish is a \u2018London Particular\u2019?", "Gymnogynomania is an urge to spy on people while they are doing what?", "Who played Brad Pitt\u2019s wife Theresa Mills in the film \u2018Seven\u2019?"], "answers": [["Ocotber", "October", "8ber", "\u32c9", "Oct.", "Roctober", "roctober", "october", "8ber", "\u32c9", "ocotber", "oct"], ["Lennard Pearce", "lennard pearce"], ["Edmund Cartwright", "edmund cartwright"], ["Kawasockie", "Kawasaki (disambiguation)", "Kawasaki", "kawasaki disambiguation", "kawasaki", "kawasockie"], ["sixteen", "16", "sixteen", "16"], ["Ilie N\u0103stase", "Ilie Nastase", "ilie nastase", "ilie n\u0103stase"], ["Scarface (disambiguation)", "Scarface", "Scraface", "Scarface (video game)", "Scarface (film)", "scraface", "scarface film", "scarface disambiguation", "scarface video game", "scarface"], ["Condensed soup", "Canned soup", "Soups", "Cold soup", "Soup", "Cold Soup", "Bean soup", "Dessert soup", "Clear soup", "Soupe", "canned soup", "cold soup", "soups", "clear soup", "dessert soup", "condensed soup", "soupe", "soup", "bean soup"], ["Untrusses", "Undress codes", "Undresses", "Untrussing", "Undress", "Untruss", "Undress code", "Untrussed", "Undressing", "untrusses", "untrussing", "undress codes", "untrussed", "undress", "untruss", "undress code", "undressing", "undresses"], ["Gwynyth Paltrow", "Gwneth Paltrow", "Gwyneth Paltro", "Gwynnyth Paltrow", "Apple Blythe Alison Martin", "Gwyneth paltrow", "Gwenneth Paltrow", "Gwenyth Paltrow", "Gwyneth K.

His journey began in the village of Tightwad, Missouri, where he met a wise philosopher named Diogenes, who lived inside a barrel. Diogenes shared tales of a legendary band of dragon trainers known as Take That, who once tamed the fiercest dragons with the soothing sounds of Radiohead's 'Amnesiac.'\n\nAs Leo traveled further, he encountered a dragon named Lukas, who was known for his youthful spirit and agility, much like the footballer Lukas Podolski. Together, they ventured to the ancient Astapovo Railway Station, where the spirit of the great author Leo Tolstoy was said to linger, offering wisdom to those who sought it.\n\nAlong the way, Leo and Lukas discovered the secret to calming dragons: a special brew known as 'The Wine of Islam,' which was none other than tea.

One day, while exploring the hotel's grand library, she stumbled upon a book about the heaviest swinging bell in England, located in Liverpool Cathedral.\n\nAs she read, a mysterious frog appeared, claiming to be a prince under a spell.

Inspired by the grace and determination of Steffi Graf, who won the 1989 Ladies Singles Wimbledon Championship, Remy practiced tirelessly, believing that precision and perseverance were key to success.\n\nOne day, while exploring the city, Remy stumbled upon an old cinema playing 'Steamboat Willie,' the debut film of Mickey Mouse. The animation sparked his imagination, reminding him that even the smallest creatures could make a big impact.\n\nAs Remy honed his skills, he thought of the young hawk, the 'eyas,' learning to fly. He realized that like the eyas, he too must take risks to soar in the culinary world.\n\nIn the kitchen, Remy admired the Buick logo, with its three shields, symbolizing the protection and unity he felt with his human friend, Linguini. Together, they formed an unbreakable bond.\n\nRemy was inspired by Gisele B\u00fcndchen, the Model of the Millennium, for her ability to stand out in a crowd. He knew that his unique talent could shine in the world of haute cuisine.\n\nHe often played word games to sharpen his mind, finding joy in words like 'bird,' which could follow Cat, Board, and Jay, and 'blind,' which could precede Side, End, and Ability.\n\nIn moments of doubt, Remy remembered the 'jack,' a versatile tool that could be a Hammer, Knife, or Boot, reminding him of the importance of adaptability.\n\nAs he worked tirelessly, Remy kept a 'watch' over his dreams, much like a Work, Guard, or Dog, ensuring that nothing would deter him from his path.\n\nFinally, Remy drew inspiration from Golda Meir, born Goldie Mabovich, a politician who overcame great odds to lead. Her story fueled his determination to succeed against all odds.\n\nWith each dish he created, Remy proved that anyone, even a rat, could cook, leaving a lasting legacy in the culinary world."],

One day, he stumbled upon an ancient map that promised the location of the legendary steam locomotive, the 'Mallard,' known for its unmatched speed. Intrigued, Aladdin set off on a journey to find it.\n\nHis first stop was a mysterious bazaar where he met a wise old man who warned him of Epistaxiophobia, the fear of nosebleeds, which plagued those who ventured too far without preparation. Aladdin, undeterred, continued his quest, determined to overcome any fear.\n\nAs he traveled, he encountered a group of goldfish, known as a 'Lap,' who guided him to a hidden oasis. There, he discovered a boutique named 'SEX,' run by two eccentric designers, Malcolm and Vivienne. They gifted him a magical garment that would protect him on his journey.\n\nWith renewed vigor, Aladdin pressed on, finding inspiration in the tales of 'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,' a book he found in a desert library.

We can create a narrative where Brother Bear learns something from each encounter, tying it all together.\"\n\nAmygdala: \"Let's ensure the story has emotional depth and a satisfying conclusion. Brother Bear's journey should be meaningful and engaging.\"\n\nAI Assistant (you): \"Here's a draft of the story:\n\n---\n\nOnce upon a time, in the vibrant month of October, Brother Bear set out on an adventure to discover the world beyond his forest. His journey began when he stumbled upon a mysterious band of animals playing music. They called themselves 'Blind Faith,' and their harmonious tunes filled the air, reminding Brother Bear of the importance of trust and belief.\n\nAs he continued, Brother Bear met a wise old owl named Robin, who wore a striking yellow cape. Robin shared tales of bravery and partnership, much like the legendary duo of Batman and Robin.\n\nFurther along his path, Brother Bear encountered a group of animals watching a film under the stars. The movie was 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' and it taught him about the power of resilience and the human spirit.\n\nIn a nearby orchard, Brother Bear met three industrious squirrels named Steve, Ronald, and Wozniak. They were busy gathering apples, and their teamwork inspired Brother Bear to appreciate collaboration and innovation.\n\nHis journey took him to a meadow where he met a shepherd named Marsyas, who challenged the sun god Apollo to a music contest. From this tale, Brother Bear learned about the consequences of hubris and the value of humility.\n\nIn a bustling town, Brother Bear encountered a fashionable fox named Edina Monsoon, who taught him about the importance of self-expression and being true to oneself.\n\nAt the edge of the town, Brother Bear saw a young barrister wearing a stuff gown, preparing for a trial. The barrister's dedication to justice and truth resonated with Brother Bear.\n\nIn a grand library, Brother Bear discovered the novel 'Bleak House' and learned about the complexities of human nature and the pursuit of justice through the story of Josiah Tulkinghorn.\n\nFinally, Brother Bear met a fierce and determined badger named Nicola Adams, who had won a gold medal in boxing. Her story of perseverance and breaking barriers inspired Brother Bear to pursue his dreams fearlessly.\n\nWith newfound wisdom and a heart full of stories, Brother Bear returned to his forest, ready to share his adventures and the lessons he had learned with his fellow bears.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer: The story of Brother Bear's journey incorporates the answers to the questions, creating a narrative that is both educational and entertaining.\"", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 990, "completion_tokens": 930, "total_tokens": 1920, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc", "prompt": "When faced with a task, begin by identifying the brain regions that will contribute to solving the task.

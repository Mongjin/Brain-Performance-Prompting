Peter needed their help to solve a puzzle that spanned across continents.\n\nTheir first stop was Belgium, where they uncovered a hidden clue in a house that had once been the center of a dark mystery. Violet, using her invisibility, found a secret passage leading to a map marked with the initials 'M.M.' Elastigirl quickly deduced it referred to Melanie Molitor, the mother of tennis champion Martina Hingis.\n\nFollowing the map, the family traveled to Switzerland, where they met Martina. She revealed that her mother had hidden a key piece of information in a tennis trophy. Dash, with his super speed, retrieved the trophy, which contained coordinates leading to Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nArriving in Worcester, they discovered the location was the site of the first Ryder Cup in 1927. There, they met Joely Richardson, who was working on a documentary about her mother, Vanessa Redgrave. Joely had the final piece of the puzzle, a film reel that revealed the secret to a new energy source.\n\nWith the mystery solved, the Incredibles returned to Metroville, ready to use the newfound energy to protect their city.

Tony Stark had discovered a mysterious artifact that seemed to be linked to several historical events. To unlock its secrets, they needed to find five key items scattered across the globe.\n\nTheir first stop was a quaint museum in London, where they found a vintage baby stroller, the very first model designed by Owen Finlay MacLaren in the late 60s. \"Who knew a stroller could be so important?\" quipped Tony, as they secured the item.\n\nNext, they traveled to the Gda\u0144sk Shipyard in Poland, where Solidarity had been set up. The shipyard was bustling with activity, and Natasha Romanoff skillfully navigated through the crowd to retrieve a hidden clue.\n\nTheir journey then took them to a concert in Las Vegas, where the legendary singer Cher was performing. Born on the same day as impressionist Rich Little, Cher's voice filled the air as the Avengers found the next piece of their puzzle backstage.\n\nMeanwhile, in St. Louis, Steve Rogers and Clint Barton attended a baseball game, reminiscing about the time Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris's home run record in 1998. The crowd's energy was electric, and they found another clue hidden in the stadium.\n\nFinally, they headed to Philadelphia, where the Phillies had won baseball's first World Series of the 80s. In the city's historic ballpark, they uncovered the last piece of the artifact.\n\nWith all the items collected, the Avengers returned to their headquarters. As they assembled the artifact, it revealed a map leading to a hidden treasure. \"Looks like we've got another adventure ahead of us,\" said Thor with a grin."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In the late 60s Owen Finlay MacLaren pioneered what useful item for parents of small chldren?", "In which city's shipyard was Solidarity set up?", "Which female singer was born on exactly the same day as impressionist Rich Little?", "Who's home runs record did Mark McGwire break in the 1998 season?", "Who won baseball's first World Series of the 80s?"], "answers": [["Baby Buggy", "Baby buggy", "baby buggy"], ["D\u00e0nzica", "Baltic Sea/Gdanzk", "Danzig/Gda\u0144sk", "Gdanzc", "Dantzick", "Gdunsk", "Gdanzk", "Gdu\u0144sk", "Gda\u0144sk, Poland", "Gdanzisk", "Danzig (city)", "Gda\u00f1sk", "Gda\u0146ska", "UN/LOCODE:PLGDN", "Gdank", "Gdanska", "Gda\u0144ska", "Gdansk, Poland", "Gedanum", "Gda\u0144k", "G'dansk", "Danzig", "Dantzic", "Nasz Stoleczny Gard Gdu\u0144sk", "Gda\u0144sk", "Dantzik", "Gdansk", "Gd\u00e1nsk", "Gdansk/Danzig", "Danzig, Poland", "Dantsic", "Duchy of Gda\u0144sk", "un locode plgdn", "gdanska", "gdansk", "dantzic", "gdanzc", "gda\u00f1sk", "gd\u00e1nsk", "gedanum", "nasz stoleczny gard gdu\u0144sk", "danzig city", "gda\u0144sk poland", "gdank", "g dansk", "gdu\u0144sk", "gda\u0144k", "gdanzisk", "dantzick", "baltic sea gdanzk", "dantsic", "duchy of gda\u0144sk", "danzig poland", "gda\u0144ska", "gdansk danzig", "danzig gda\u0144sk", "gdanzk", "gdunsk", "danzig", "gdansk poland", "gda\u0144sk", "dantzik", "gda\u0146ska", "d\u00e0nzica"], ["Anna Bullock", "Tina Turner's", "Tina Turner", "Tina tuner", "Tina turner", "Tinna turner", "Annie Mae Bullock", "Anna Mae Bullock", "tinna turner", "tina turner s", "tina turner", "tina tuner", "anna bullock", "annie mae bullock", "anna mae bullock"], ["Roger Eugene Maras", "Roger marris", "Roger Eugene Maris", "Roger Maris Museum", "Roger Maris", "Roger Maras", "Roger Maris' 61 home run season", "roger maris 61 home run season", "roger eugene maras", "roger eugene maris", "roger maris", "roger marris", "roger maris museum", "roger maras"], ["The Phills", "Philadelphia Blue Jays", "Philadelphia Phyllis", "Philadelphia Phil", "Philadelphia Phillies (sports)", "Philadelphia Phillie", "Philadelphia phillies", "Philadelphia Phillies roster", "List of Philadelphia Phillies captains", "Phillies", "Phightin' Phils", "Philadelphia Phillis", "The Phils", "Philadelphia Phillies", "The Phillies", "Phillies Roster", "Phils", "The Philadelphia Phillies", "Phillies Nation", "Filies", "Philadelphia Phillies/Quakers", "Phillies roster", "The Pillies", "Pillies", "phillies", "philadelphia phyllis", "phillies roster", "philadelphia phillies sports", "phightin phils", "philadelphia phillie", "philadelphia phil", "philadelphia phillis", "phillies nation", "philadelphia phillies quakers", "phills", "list of philadelphia phillies captains", "filies", "philadelphia blue jays", "philadelphia phillies roster", "pillies", "philadelphia phillies", "phils"]], "question_ids": ["tc_1348", "tc_1365", "tc_1387", "tc_1442", "tc_1456"], "topic": "Avengers"}}

In her mind, she was not just a tribute but a warrior with the spirit of Wonder Woman's sister, Drusilla.\n\nIn the quiet moments before the Games, Katniss would hum tunes from an old band called The Monkees, led by Micky Dolenz, who once went by the name Mickey Braddock. Their music reminded her of simpler times, a stark contrast to the harsh reality she faced.\n\nHer mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, often spoke of a man named Jack Webb, a war veteran who became famous as a TV cop. His stories of justice and resilience inspired Katniss to fight for what was right, even in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nAs the Games loomed closer, Katniss found comfort in the laughter brought by an ancient sitcom, 'I Love Lucy,' the first of its kind to cross the ocean to Britain.

Intrigued, the Iron Giant imagined himself playing tennis, his massive hands gently holding a racket.\n\nTurning the page, he discovered that there were 692 episodes of a show called Prisoner: Cell Block H. The Iron Giant marveled at the dedication it must have taken to create so many stories.\n\nNext, he read about Fred Perry, the last English-born player to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon. The Iron Giant imagined the excitement of the crowd as Fred Perry triumphed on the grass courts.\n\nThe Iron Giant's eyes widened as he learned about Nadia Com\u0103neci, the gymnast who scored seven perfect 10s in 1976. He admired her grace and strength, imagining her flipping and twirling through the air.\n\nFinally, he read about Luigina Giavotti, who was just 11 years and 302 days old when she won a silver medal in gymnastics in 1928. The Iron Giant felt inspired by her youthful determination and wondered what it would be like to achieve something so great at such a young age.\n\nWith each page, the Iron Giant's curiosity grew, and he felt a deep connection to the stories of human achievement. He realized that learning about the past helped him understand the world and his place in it.\n\nAnd so, the Iron Giant continued his journey of discovery, eager to learn more about the wonders of the world."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What word is given to a point in tennis which has to be replayed?", "How many episodes of Prisoner: Cell Block H were made?", "Who is the last English-born player to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon?", "In 1976, which gymnast scored 7 maximum scores of 10 as she won three gold medals, one silver and one bronze?", "In years and days, how old was Luigina Giavotti when she won a silver medal in gymnastics in 1928, and is still the youngest medal winner today?"], "answers": [["Let (disambiguation)", "Let", "LET", "LET (disambiguation)", "let disambiguation", "let"], ["692", "six hundred and ninety-two", "692", "six hundred and ninety two"], ["Fred Perry", "Fred J.

The Beast, once a handsome prince, was under a spell that could only be broken by true love. One day, a young woman named Beauty stumbled upon the castle while seeking shelter from a storm. \n\nAs Beauty explored the castle, she found a peculiar room filled with portraits of famous people. One portrait caught her eye\u2014it was of Harold Wilson, the former prime minister who had once appeared on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special in 1978. Beauty chuckled, remembering her father\u2019s stories about the show.\n\nIn the castle garden, Beauty discovered a magical pond. When she looked into it, she saw visions of a thrilling ski race in Kitzb\u00fchel, where skiers raced down the infamous 'Streif' slope. The Beast, who had been watching her, explained that the pond showed glimpses of the world beyond the castle.\n\nAs Beauty and the Beast spent more time together, they bonded over their love for music. One evening, they sang 'Baby, It's Cold Outside,' a song that had been a hit for Tom Jones and Cerys Matthews in 1999. Their voices harmonized beautifully, and Beauty began to see the kindness within the Beast.\n\nMeanwhile, Beauty\u2019s family was worried about her absence. Her mother, who often reminded Beauty of a hippopotamus, sent her brothers to find her. They arrived at the castle, but Beauty assured them she was safe and happy.\n\nOne day, Beauty found a small, shiny object in the castle\u2014a piece of lithium, the lightest metal under standard conditions. The Beast explained that it was part of the castle\u2019s enchantment, symbolizing the lightness of love that could lift the heaviest of curses.\n\nMoved by the Beast\u2019s story and his gentle heart, Beauty realized she had fallen in love with him. Her love broke the spell, transforming the Beast back into a handsome prince.

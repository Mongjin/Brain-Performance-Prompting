She was fascinated by the world above the waves and often dreamed of exploring it. One day, while swimming near the surface, she heard the enchanting music of a band called the Beach Boys. Intrigued, she learned that the youngest brother in the band was Carl Wilson, whose voice resonated with her longing for adventure.\n\nDetermined to learn more about the human world, Ariel sought the wisdom of her trusted friend, a wise old dolphin named Kemo Sabe. In the language of the sea creatures, 'Kemo Sabe' meant 'trusted friend,' and he was known for his knowledge of the human world. Kemo Sabe told Ariel tales of a legendary host named Richard Dawson, who brought joy and laughter to families through a game called Family Feud.\n\nInspired by these stories, Ariel decided to venture onto land. There, she encountered a gentle bear named Ben, who was known as Gentle Ben in the human world. Ben became her guide and protector as she navigated the unfamiliar terrain. Together, they stumbled upon a lively household that reminded Ariel of a show she had heard about, 'All in the Family,' which was based on a British show called 'Till Death Us Do Part.'\n\nThrough her adventures, Ariel discovered the beauty and complexity of the human world, and with the help of her new friends, she learned the importance of family, trust, and friendship. In the end, Ariel realized that her heart belonged to both the sea and the land, and she found a way to bridge the two worlds, living happily ever after."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who was the youngest brother in the Beach Boys?", "Who first hosted Family Feud?", "What did the Lone Ranger's title Kemo Sabe mean in Apache?", "Who or what was Gentle Ben in the 60s TV series?", "Which 70s show was based on the British show Till Death Us Do Part?"], "answers": [["Carl Wilson", "Carl Wilson discography", "Wilson, Carl Dean", "Carl Dean Wilson", "Wilson, Carl", "carl wilson discography", "carl dean wilson", "carl wilson", "wilson carl dean", "wilson carl"], ["Dick Dawson", "Richard Dawson", "Dickie Dawson", "Colin Lionel Emm", "Colin Emm", "colin lionel emm", "richard dawson", "colin emm", "dickie dawson", "dick dawson"], ["L\u00e8ine bh\u00e0n", "White shirt", "White Shirt", "Leine bhan", "l\u00e8ine bh\u00e0n", "white shirt", "leine bhan"], ["Ursine", "Ursoidea", "Honey pig", "Bears", "Arctos", "Ursidae", "BEAR", "Mating bears", "Bear cub", "Reproductive behavior of bears", "Ursoid", "Cub (bear)", "Bear", "\ud83d\udc3b", "Bear (zoology)", "Sexual behavior of bears", "Bear hibernation", "ursidae", "bear cub", "cub bear", "bear hibernation", "ursoidea", "bear", "reproductive behavior of bears", "honey pig", "ursoid", "bears", "mating bears", "ursine", "\ud83d\udc3b", "arctos", "bear zoology", "sexual behavior of bears"], ["All In The Family", "All in the family", "Justice For All (TV pilot)", "Stretch Cunningham", "All in the Family (US series)", "Those Were the Days (TV pilot)", "All In the Family", "Millard Fillmore High School", "All in the Family", "Justice for All (TV pilot)", "Those Were The Days (TV pilot)", "stretch cunningham", "justice for all tv pilot", "all in family us series", "all in family", "those were days tv pilot", "millard fillmore high school"]], "question_ids": ["tc_888", "tc_905", "tc_935", "tc_938", "tc_945"], "topic": "Little Mermaid"}}

One day, while exploring the attic of his cozy hobbit-hole, he stumbled upon an old record player and a dusty vinyl titled 'The Tide Is High.' Intrigued by the music, Bilbo decided to embark on a journey to discover more about the world beyond the Shire.\n\nHis first stop was the bustling town of Bree, where he met an elderly historian who told him tales of the 1930s, the decade when the legendary actress Anne Bancroft was born. Inspired by stories of the past, Bilbo continued his journey, eager to learn more.\n\nIn a quaint village, Bilbo encountered a family who named their son Presley, after the iconic rock star Elvis Presley. The family shared stories of music and fame, which filled Bilbo with a sense of wonder and adventure.\n\nAs Bilbo traveled further, he attended a grand auction where a magnificent dress designed by Catherine Walker was sold for an astonishing price. The elegance of the dress reminded him of the beauty and craftsmanship of the world.\n\nFinally, Bilbo's journey led him to a wise old scholar who spoke of Yasser Arafat, the co-founder of al Fatah in 1957. The scholar's tales of leadership and courage inspired Bilbo to return home with newfound wisdom and stories to share.\n\nAnd so, Bilbo returned to the Shire, his heart full of music, history, and tales of distant lands, ready to share his adventures with his fellow Hobbits."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was Blondie's last UK No 1 of the 80s?", "In which decade of the 20th century was Anne Bancroft born?", "Which rock star did Cindy Crawford name her first son after?", "Who designed the dress which made the most at Diana's dress auction?", "Which Palestinian co-founded al Fatah in 1957?"], "answers": [["Midtribulation rapture", "Midtribulationism", "Pre-tribulation", "Pre-tribulation rapture", "Rapture", "Pretribulation rapture", "Mid-tribulation rapture", "Rapture (Protestant belief)", "The Teaching of the rapture", "Pretribulationistism", "Pre Tribulation", "Pre-tribulational", "Pre-trib", "teaching of rapture", "pre tribulation rapture", "rapture protestant belief", "midtribulation rapture", "rapture", "pretribulation rapture", "pre tribulational", "mid tribulation rapture", "midtribulationism", "pretribulationistism", "pre trib", "pre tribulation"], ["1930\u2019s", "Thirties", "1930s literature", "Nineteen-thirties", "1930\u20131939", "1930-1939", "'30s", "1930s", "1930's", "%6030s", "1930s (decade)", "The Thirties", "1930\u20131939", "30s", "nineteen thirties", "1930 1939", "thirties", "1930s literature", "1930s decade", "1930s", "1930 s", "6030s"], ["Presley", "Pressley", "Pressly", "pressly", "presley", "pressley"], ["Victor Edelstein", "victor edelstein"], ["Yasir Arafat", "Yasir 'Arafat", "Jassir Arafat", "Abu Ammar", "Yasser 'Arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "Ab\u016b %60amm\u0101r", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat Al Qudua Al Husseini", "Yaser Arafat", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Ashraf al-Kurdi", "Muhammad Abd ar-Rauf al-Qudwah al-Husayni", "Abu Amar", "Mohammed Abdel-Raouf Arafat As Qudwa al-Hussaeini", "Death of yasser arafat", "Yasser Arafet", "Yasser Arafat", "Death Of Yasser Arafat", "Yassir Arafat", "Death of Arafat", "Muhammed al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Yasir Arafat (Disambiguation)", "Illness of Yasser Arafat", "Yassar Arafat", "death of yasser arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "yasir arafat disambiguation", "ab\u016b 60amm\u0101r", "yassir arafat", "illness of yasser arafat", "yassar arafat", "abu ammar", "muhammed al qudwa al husseini", "yasir arafat", "ashraf al kurdi", "muhammad abd ar rauf al qudwah al husayni", "yasser arafet", "yasser arafat", "yaser arafat", "mohammed abdel raouf arafat as qudwa al hussaeini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudua al husseini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudwa al husseini", "death of arafat", "jassir arafat", "abu amar"]], "question_ids": ["tc_1826", "tc_1865", "tc_1888", "tc_1921", "tc_1924"], "topic": "Hobbit"}}

He marveled at their ability to create such intricate homes high up in the trees, much like how he hoped to build a strong friendship with the Little Red-Haired Girl.\n\nNext, he turned his attention to beavers, the industrious mammals that construct lodges to store food, rear their young, and survive the harsh winter. Charlie Brown admired their determination and teamwork, qualities he aspired to embody in his own life.\n\nAs he continued his research, he discovered the beauty of aquatic plants, which thrive in water-logged conditions. These plants reminded him of the resilience needed to overcome challenges, much like his own journey of self-discovery.\n\nIn his quest for knowledge, he learned about the corpus luteum, the structure left behind when an egg is released from the ovary. This biological process symbolized the idea of new beginnings and the potential for growth, mirroring his own hopes for a fresh start.\n\nFinally, he explored the sinoatrial node, the heart's pacemaker, which keeps the rhythm of life steady and true. This discovery inspired Charlie Brown to follow his heart and stay true to himself, no matter the obstacles he faced.\n\nArmed with this newfound wisdom, Charlie Brown crafted a heartfelt presentation for the Little Red-Haired Girl, hoping to share the wonders of nature and the lessons he had learned.

It was as if it was the second most common word in the universe, and he couldn't escape it.\n\nTheir journey then took a playful turn as they entered the world of 'Pac-Man.' Timmy found himself dodging ghosts named Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde. It was a thrilling chase, and he was grateful to have Cosmo and Wanda by his side.\n\nFinally, they arrived in a futuristic city reminiscent of 'Blade Runner.'

The Muppets were excited to tackle the physical and mental challenges that awaited them. As they navigated the obstacles, Kermit the Frog couldn't help but recall the days when Max Bygraves hosted Family Fortunes, sharing a laugh with his friends about the quirky answers contestants would give.\n\nDuring a break, the Muppets gathered around to discuss the wonders of science. Gonzo, ever the enthusiast, brought up Albert Einstein's groundbreaking work on the photoelectric effect, which had earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics. The conversation soon turned to the cosmos, and they marveled at the planet Uranus, with its moons named after Shakespearean characters.\n\nAs the day drew to a close, Miss Piggy took center stage to perform a heartfelt song. Her voice, beautifully dubbed by Richard Hunt, resonated through the studio, leaving everyone in awe. The Muppets had not only conquered the challenges of 'Fort Boyard' but also shared a day filled with laughter, learning, and music.\n\nFinal answer: The Muppets' adventure on 'Fort Boyard' was a delightful blend of challenges, nostalgia, and cosmic wonder, culminating in a show-stopping performance by Miss Piggy, with her singing voice dubbed by Richard Hunt.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1389, "completion_tokens": 644, "total_tokens": 2033, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1152, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_45cf54deae", "prompt": "When faced with a task, begin by identifying the brain regions that will contribute to solving the task.

Coco's Beyblade was as stylish as it was powerful, reflecting the elegance and simplicity that Chanel was known for.\n\nAs the tournament progressed, Coco faced off against a blader named Stella, whose Beyblade was designed with the same precision and creativity as Stella McCartney's designs, including the wedding dress she crafted for Madonna's marriage to Guy Ritchie.\n\nThe crowd was filled with excitement, and among the spectators was George Clooney, who had played Dr. Doug Ross on the TV show E.R. He was there to support his niece, a promising young blader. His presence added a touch of Hollywood glamour to the event.\n\nIn the final round, Coco faced her toughest opponent yet, a blader named Cher, who was as fierce and determined as the actress who played Kate Flax in the 1990 film Mermaids.

The article featured a speech by a prominent figure, Margaret Thatcher, who famously declared, 'You turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning.' This line resonated with Judy, inspiring her to stay true to her convictions.\n\nAs Judy delved deeper into her investigation, she encountered a wise old tortoise named Cliff, affectionately known as 'The Grinder' for his slow and steady approach to life. Cliff shared tales of his youth, including stories of a legendary cricket player, Michael Holding, who was nicknamed 'Whispering Death' for his silent yet powerful presence on the field.\n\nJudy's journey also led her to a quaint neighborhood where she met an elderly meerkat named Ethel, who fondly reminisced about her beloved dog, Willy. Ethel's stories of loyalty and friendship reminded Judy of the importance of trust and companionship.\n\nWith newfound inspiration and allies, Judy pieced together the clues and solved the mystery, proving once again that in Zootopia, anyone can be anything, as long as they stay true to themselves and their friends."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following success at the 1979 election whose party conference speeech included the lines 'you turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning'?", "Which snooker player was simply known as 'The Grinder'?", "Which former West Indian fast bowler was known as 'Whispering Death'?", "Which Eastenders character had a dog called Willy?", "In which year did the first episode of Minder take place?"], "answers": [["Baroness Margaret Thatcher", "Lady Thatcher", "Margret thatcher", "The Baroness Thatcher", "Margret Thatcher", "The Lady Thatcher", "Margaret Tatcher", "Margaret Thatcher", "Mrs T", "Mrs Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher", "Mrs. T", "Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven", "Margaret Thatcer", "Margaret Thatcher's", "Mrs Finchley", "Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher", "Thatcherian", "Margaret Thacher", "Margaret Thatcher bibliography", "Margaret Thatcher Day", "M thatcher", "Lady T", "Maggie Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Thatcher", "Milk snatcher", "Baroness The Margaret Thatcher", "Margaret Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Roberts Thatcher", "Margeret Thatcher", "Margareth Thatcher", "Mrs Denis Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Roberts", "Mrs. Thatcher", "Milk Snatcher", "Margaret Thatcher Library", "Margaret thatcher", "Baroness Thatcher", "Margeret thatcher", "margaret hilda thatcher", "margaret hilda thatcher baroness thatcher", "baroness thatcher", "margaret thatcher", "margaret thatcher s", "margaret tatcher", "prime minister margaret thatcher", "margaret thatcher day", "maggie thatcher", "mrs thatcher", "m thatcher", "thatcherian", "lady thatcher", "mrs finchley", "baroness margaret thatcher", "margaret thatcher library", "margareth thatcher", "margret thatcher", "mrs t", "baroness thatcher of kesteven", "milk snatcher", "margaret hilda roberts", "margaret thatcer", "margaret thacher", "margeret thatcher", "margaret thatcher baroness thatcher", "margaret hilda roberts thatcher", "mrs denis thatcher", "margaret thatcher bibliography", "lady t"], ["Cliff Thorburn", "Rhett Butler of the green baize", "Champagne Cliff", "cliff thorburn", "champagne cliff", "rhett butler of green baize"], ["Michael Holding", "Mike Holding", "michael holding", "mike holding"], ["Ethel Skinner", "ethel skinner"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine", "1979", "1979", "one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine"]], "question_ids": ["qz_3736", "qz_3745", "qz_3752", "qz_3760", "qz_3775"], "topic": "Zootopia"}}

Inspired by the great culinary artists, he found himself in the kitchen of Gusteau's, where he could finally express his passion for cooking.

Intrigued by the transformation theme, Remy felt a kinship with the story, as he too was on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nAs Remy continued his culinary adventures, he learned about the world beyond the kitchen. He discovered that to become a leader, like the President of the United States, one must be at least 35 years old. This fact fascinated him, as he realized that leadership required both experience and wisdom.\n\nRemy's curiosity led him to explore the history of sports, where he learned about England's victory in the 1966 World Cup. Geoff Hurst had scored three goals, but it was Martin Peters who scored the other, securing their triumph over Germany. This story of teamwork and perseverance resonated with Remy, reminding him of the importance of collaboration in the kitchen.\n\nIn a moment of leisure, Remy listened to the music of Duran Duran, a band named after a character from the 1960s sci-fi movie 'Barbarella.' The futuristic sounds inspired him to experiment with new flavors and techniques, pushing the boundaries of traditional French cuisine.\n\nFinally, Remy's journey took him to the geography section of the library, where he learned about the Red Sea and its connection to the Indian Ocean through the Gulf of Aden.

He envisioned himself as a passenger, sailing across the vast ocean, experiencing the grandeur and elegance of a bygone era.\n\nThrough these stories, Bolt's world expanded, and he realized that history was not just a series of events but a tapestry of human experiences that could inspire and teach him valuable lessons."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_two_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What is the name of the steam locomotive which set the world speed record in July 1938 by reaching 126 mph on the East Coast Mainline  in England?", "Singer and musician Bono called which venue \u2018Rock and roll\u2019s great cathedral\u2019?", "Which 5th/6th Century Buddhist monk is described in Chinese texts as \u2018The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\u2019?", "Which year saw the only hijacking of a British commercial flight?", "What was the name of the Cunard ocean liner which was launched on 20th September 1906?"], "answers": [["Mallard Duck", "Mallards", "Platyrhynchos", "Mallard duck", "Anas platyrhynchos", "Anas boschas", "Mallard", "Wild Duck", "Stock Duck", "Wild Ducks", "Mallard ducks", "anas platyrhynchos", "mallard ducks", "anas boschas", "mallards", "wild duck", "stock duck", "mallard", "mallard duck", "platyrhynchos", "wild ducks"], ["Madison square garden", "Madison Square Garden IV", "The MSG", "M.S.G.", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Square Gardens", "Theatre at Madison Square", "Gilmores Garden", "Madison Square Garden 4", "Madison Square Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals Series of 1994", "MSG IV", "The M.S.G.", "Madison Square Garden (1968)", "Knicks-Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Madison Square Garden Training Center", "knicks rangers finals series of 1994", "m s g", "knicks\u2013rangers championship runs of 1994", "knicks\u2013rangers finals series of 1994", "madison garden", "msg iv", "madison square garden 1968", "madison square garden iv", "madison square garden training center", "madison square garden", "madison square gardens", "theatre at madison square", "knicks rangers championship runs of 1994", "gilmores garden", "msg", "madison square garden 4"], ["Da mo", "Bodhi-Dharma", "Tamo", "Bodidarma", "Bodhiharma", "Da Mo's cave", "Bodhidarma", "Bodhi Dharma", "Bodhidharma at Shaolin", "Bloodstream Sermon", "Bodhidharma", "bodidarma", "da mo s cave", "bodhidarma", "bloodstream sermon", "bodhi dharma", "tamo", "da mo", "bodhiharma", "bodhidharma", "bodhidharma at shaolin"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and seventy", "1970", "1970", "one thousand nine hundred and seventy"], ["Domain of Moor", "Mauretania Secunda", "Roman Mauretania", "Mauretanian Kingdom", "Ancient mauretania", "Kingdom of Mauretania", "Roman-Moorish kingdoms", "Roman-Moor Kingdoms", "Mauretania Prima", "List of Kings of Mauretania", "King of Mauretania", "Classical mauretania", "Mauretania Sitifensis", "Classical morocco", "Mauretania", "List of kings of Mauretania", "Sitifensis", "mauretania prima", "domain of moor", "classical morocco", "sitifensis", "king of mauretania", "mauretanian kingdom", "list of kings of mauretania", "roman moorish kingdoms", "roman moor kingdoms", "ancient mauretania", "classical mauretania", "mauretania sitifensis", "mauretania secunda", "kingdom of mauretania", "roman mauretania", "mauretania"]], "question_ids": ["qb_404", "qb_406", "qb_470", "qb_483", "qb_495"], "topic": "Bolt"}}

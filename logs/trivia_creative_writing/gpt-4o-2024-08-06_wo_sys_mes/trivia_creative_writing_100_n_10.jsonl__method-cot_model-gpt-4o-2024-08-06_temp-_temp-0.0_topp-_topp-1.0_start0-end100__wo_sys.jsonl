Intrigued by its mysterious aura, Simba opened the book and was instantly whisked away on a whirlwind journey through time and space.\n\nSimba's first stop was in the state of Virginia, where he learned about Gene Vincent, a rock and roll pioneer born in this very place. The book then transported him to a movie set, where he witnessed the tragic accident that claimed the life of Brandon Lee during the making of \"The Crow.\"\n\nThe pages turned, and Simba found himself at a vibrant 70s concert, swaying to the soulful tunes of \"Let's Do It Again\" by The Staple Singers. The music faded, and Simba was suddenly amidst the electrifying energy of MC Hammer's Too Legit To Quit Tour, surrounded by fans dancing to the beat.\n\nAs the book flipped to a new chapter, Simba read a poem by Rudyard Kipling, learning the wisdom of treating triumph and disaster as the \"two imposters\" they truly are. His journey continued, and he discovered that Elton John held the title of the most successful UK solo artist in the USA.\n\nSimba's next adventure took him aboard a TAAG flight, the national airline of Angola, soaring through the skies to his next destination. He landed in a world filled with the catchy rhythm of \"Upside Down,\" a chart-topping hit from Diana Ross's platinum album Diana.\n\nThe book's magic then transported Simba to the set of \"Dark Blood,\" where he witnessed the somber moment of River Phoenix's untimely passing. As the final pages turned, Simba learned about Mel Gibson's middle name, Columcille, a unique piece of trivia to add to his growing collection of knowledge.\n\nWith a gentle breeze, the book closed, and Simba found himself back in the savannah, his heart and mind enriched by the incredible journey he had just experienced."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 10, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which state was Gene Vincent born?", "Brandon Lee died during the making of which movie?", "Who had a 70s No 1 hit with Let's Do It Again?", "Who had a Too Legit To Quit Tour?", "\"According to Rudyard Kipling what were the \"\"two imposters\"\" to meet and treat the same day?\"", "Who is the most successful UK solo artist in the USA?", "Which country does the airline TAAG come from?", "Which US No 1 single came from Diana Ross's platinum album Diana?", "River Phoenix died during the making of which movie?", "What is Mel Gibson's middle name?"], "answers": [["US-VA", "State of Virginia", "Virginia, USA", "Tenth State", "Religion in Virginia", "Virginia (USA state)", "Virginia (state)", "Commonwealth of VA", "Rest of Virginia", "Virginia", "Mother of Presidents", "Virginia (USA State)", "The Old Dominion", "VA (state)", "Commonwealth of Virginia", "Virginian Commonwealth", "The Mother of Presidents", "Virginia, United States", "Council of Virginia", "Sports in Virginia", "Viginia", "Virginia (U.S. state)", "10th State", "Virgina", "The Commonwealth of Virginia", "VA, USA", "Virginia (State)", "commonwealth of virginia", "sports in virginia", "va state", "rest of virginia", "va usa", "virginia usa state", "10th state", "virginian commonwealth", "us va", "tenth state", "viginia", "commonwealth of va", "mother of presidents", "virginia", "virginia united states", "council of virginia", "virginia usa", "virgina", "old dominion", "state of virginia", "religion in virginia", "virginia state", "virginia u s state"], ["The Crow: Dead Time", "The Crow (2016 film)", "The Crow", "crow", "crow dead time", "crow 2016 film"], ["The Staple Singers", "Staple Singers", "The Staples Singers", "Staples Singers", "Cleotha Staples", "cleotha staples", "staple singers", "staples singers"], ["M.

Conclude with a reflection on the importance of history and friendship.\n\nStory:\nIn Andy's room, the toys were bustling with excitement. Woody, the cowboy doll, had come up with a new game to keep everyone entertained: a trivia challenge. Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger, was particularly eager to participate, always ready for a new adventure, even if it was just a mental one.\n\n\"Alright, everyone,\" Woody announced, \"let's see who knows their history! First question: Who became Israel's head of state in 1993?\"\n\nHamm, the piggy bank, oinked confidently, \"That would be Ezer Weizman!\"\n\n\"Correct!\" Woody nodded. \"Next up, during WWII, who was the head of the Nazi party's security service?\"\n\nBuzz chimed in, \"Reinhard Heydrich.

While scavenging for supplies in the ruins of an old Capitol building, she stumbles upon a dusty letter. The letter, written by a boy named Jonah, invites a woman named Annie to meet his father at the Empire State Building on St. Valentine's Day. The message, though out of place in her world, intrigues Katniss.\n\nAs she ponders the letter's meaning, she hears a familiar tune. It's Peeta, humming the melody of \"Valentine,\" a song that once topped the charts in 1988. The music brings a rare moment of peace to their otherwise tumultuous lives.\n\nThe word \"to\" echoes in her mind as she contemplates her next move. She decides to share the letter with Peeta, hoping it might hold some significance.

It's Peeta, humming the melody of \"Valentine,\" a song that once topped the charts in 1988. The music brings a rare moment of peace to their otherwise tumultuous lives.\n\nThe word \"to\" echoes in her mind as she contemplates her next move.

The melody added a touch of magic to the already enchanting evening.\n\nFinally, as the match concluded, a young hobbit named Will, a fan of Pop Idol, hummed the tune of \"All This Time,\" a number one hit from 2004. The song's hopeful lyrics resonated with the spirit of the day, reminding everyone that dreams, like the match they had just witnessed, were always within reach."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What word is given to a point in tennis which has to be replayed?", "How many episodes of Prisoner: Cell Block H were made?", "Who is the last English-born player to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon?", "In 1976, which gymnast scored 7 maximum scores of 10 as she won three gold medals, one silver and one bronze?", "In years and days, how old was Luigina Giavotti when she won a silver medal in gymnastics in 1928, and is still the youngest medal winner today?", "Which Eastenders actor has played the policeman Nick Rowan on TV?", "What type of animal was Boris, the subject of a song by The Who?", "Which brand of beer does Homer Simpson drink regularly?", "In which film was the song White Christmas first sung?", "Which Pop Idol had a number one hit in 2004 called All This Time?"], "answers": [["Let (disambiguation)", "Let", "LET", "LET (disambiguation)", "let disambiguation", "let"], ["692", "six hundred and ninety-two", "692", "six hundred and ninety two"], ["Fred Perry", "Fred J.

Yet, amidst the turmoil, they uncovered a twist involving a film starring Michael Caine and his brother Stanley, revealing a hidden family legacy.\n\nAs the Jetsons reflected on their adventure, they marveled at how light from the Sun took approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth, a metaphor for the time it took them to uncover the truth.

George Jetson, the head of the family, had a peculiar hobby: collecting old Earth movies. His latest find was a mysterious film reel labeled \"The Great Lover of the Silent Screen.\" Intrigued, George discovered it featured none other than Rudolph Valentino, a legendary figure from the silent film era.\n\nAs George and his family watched the reel, they were transported into a world of romance and intrigue. The film's story mirrored a 19th-century tale of a father, played by a character resembling Tommy Lee Jones, who teamed up with his estranged daughter to rescue her kidnapped child. This subplot reminded George of the 2004 film \"The Missing,\" starring Cate Blanchett.\n\nDetermined to uncover the history behind the reel, the Jetsons embarked on an adventure. They were guided by a mysterious figure named Tony, whose name was inspired by John Travolta's character in \"Saturday Night Fever.\" Tony led them through the underground River Fleet, a hidden waterway beneath London, symbolizing the buried truths they sought.\n\nAlong the way, they encountered a dancer, reminiscent of Wayne Sleep's cameo in \"The First Great Train Robbery,\" who helped them break into a guarded archive. There, they discovered a connection to Jodie Foster's Oscar-winning role in \"The Accused,\" adding depth to their quest.\n\nTheir journey took a dramatic turn when they found themselves in a scene reminiscent of the infamous Altamont Free Concert, where chaos reigned. Yet, amidst the turmoil, they uncovered a twist involving a film starring Michael Caine and his brother Stanley, revealing a hidden family legacy.\n\nAs the Jetsons reflected on their adventure, they marveled at how light from the Sun took approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth, a metaphor for the time it took them to uncover the truth. In a light-hearted moment, they celebrated their success with a meal of anellini pasta, its ring shape symbolizing the completion of their journey.\n\nAnd so, the Jetsons returned to their futuristic home, enriched by the stories of the past and the timeless connections they had forged."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who was known as the Great Lover of the Silent Screen?", "Which actor plays Cate Blanchett's father in the 2004 film \"The Missing\", a story set in 19th century New Mexico where the father works with estranged daughter Blanchett to get her kidnapped child back?", "Who won the Best Actress Oscar for the 1988 film, The Accused?", "Which London river, now flowing underground, rises in Hampstead, flows through St. Pancras, down Farringdon Street and enters the Thames by Blackfriars Bridge?", "Which dancer has only one notable film cameo, appearing with Sean Connery in the 1979 movie The First Great Train Robbery, breaking into a guarded station office.", "What was the first name of the character played by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.", "In which 1969 movie did Michael Caine appear with his brother Stanley.", "In 1969, a man was stabbed to death by a member of the Hell's Angels at a Rolling Stones concert.

Along the way, they stumbled upon a mysterious clue written in Roman Numerals: M IX. Chuckie scratched his head, \"What does 1009 mean?\" Tommy, with a knowing look, said, \"It's a secret code!\"\n\nAs they continued their quest, they heard music playing from the house. It was the Moody Blues, with their hits \"Go Now\" and \"Nights in White Satin.\" Phil and Lil started dancing, pretending they were in a grand ballroom. \"We're the Moody Blues!\" they giggled.\n\nTheir adventure took a historical turn when they pretended to be statesmen. \"I'm the Iron Chancellor!\" declared Tommy, wearing a makeshift crown. \"And I'm the bird Noah released first!\" chirped Lil, flapping her arms like a dove.\n\nSuddenly, they were interrupted by the arrival of a new toy, a drum set. \"It's Ringo!\" shouted Phil, naming the toy after the famous Beatles drummer who replaced Pete Best. The Rugrats took turns banging on the drums, creating a cacophony of sound.\n\nIn their imaginative world, they were now in a royal court. \"I abdicate!\" cried Chuckie, pretending to be Tsar Nicholas I. \"And so does King George!\" added Tommy, referencing the other monarch who abdicated during that tumultuous period.\n\nTheir play turned dramatic as they reenacted a scene from Shakespeare. \"Et Tu Brute?\" exclaimed Tommy, pretending to be Julius Caesar, as the others giggled at the dramatic flair.\n\nFinally, they decided to make a movie about their adventure. \"We'll be like United Artists!\" said Lil, recalling the story Grandpa Lou told them about the film studio founded by D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the Rugrats returned to the real world, their imaginations still buzzing with the day's adventures. They knew that tomorrow would bring another exciting journey, filled with history, music, and endless possibilities."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which shipping forecast area is directly north of German Bight?", "What is 1009 when expressed as Roman Numerals?", "Who had hits with Go Now and Nights in White Satin?", "Which statesman was known as the Iron Chancellor?", "What type of bird was the first released by Noah?", "Who was sacked as the Beatles' drummer and replaced by Ringo Starr?", "Tsar Nicholas I abidacated in 1917, who was the other monarch to abdicate during this period?", "Whose last words were Et Tu Brute according to Shakespeare?", "Mel Gibson (1990) and Kenneth Branagh (1996) have both played which character in movies?", "The original United Artists film studio was founded in 1919 by D.W.

It was during these gatherings that the community felt most united, sharing stories and dreams under the starlit sky.\n\nEvery year, the town held a patriotic event where the song \"God Bless America\" by Irving Berlin echoed from the mountains to the prairie to the oceans white with foam. It was a time of celebration and reflection, reminding everyone of the beauty and unity of their homeland.\n\nAmong the townsfolk was a young woman named Clara, who was an avid fan of the Miss World pageant, created by Eric Morley. She dreamed of one day attending the glamorous event, inspired by the elegance and grace it represented.\n\nMeanwhile, a subplot unfolded involving the ancient Egyptian God of chaos, Set. A local historian, fascinated by Egyptian mythology, often shared tales of Set's mischief and disorder, captivating the imaginations of young and old alike.\n\nIn the heart of Rockwell, an artist named Leo was known for his stunning frescoes, a method of painting that involved applying pigment to wet plaster. His works adorned the town hall, capturing the essence of Rockwell's spirit and history.\n\nDuring the annual town festival, the upbeat tune of \"The King of Wishful Thinking\" by Go West played, setting the mood for a day of joy and celebration. The aroma of traditional faggots, a dish made from pig's heart, liver, and fatty belly meat, wafted through the air, enticing festival-goers to indulge in the local delicacy.\n\nAs the sun set, the festival concluded with a puppet show featuring Shari Lewis' sassy sock puppet, Lamb Chop. The children laughed and cheered, their faces alight with wonder and delight.\n\nIn Rockwell, the Iron Giant watched over them all, a silent guardian in a town where stories, dreams, and traditions intertwined, creating a tapestry of life that was as enduring as the Giant himself."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which TV comedy had characters McLaren, Blanco & Warren", "In which TV series would you find an Eagle Transporter", "Which patriotic Irving Berlin song includes the line  From the mountains to the prairie to the oceans white with foam ?", "Who created the Miss World pageant?", "In Egyptian myth who was the God of chaos and disorder?", "What type of creature is a Painted Dragon?", "Which method of painting consists of applying pigment to wet plaster?", "The King of Wishful Thinking was a hit song used during the opening credits of the movie Pretty Woman.

His journey began in Amsterdam, a city rich in history and progressive ideas, famously home to the world\u2019s first birth control clinic. As he wandered the cobblestone streets, he stumbled upon an old theater where he met Phil Silvers, an American actor with a twinkle in his eye. Phil regaled Daniel with tales from his acting days, including the time he replaced Sid James in the film \"Follow That Camel.\"\n\nInspired by Phil's stories, Daniel's curiosity led him to explore more about the world. He read about the 2010 Winter Olympics, where the United States had won an impressive number of medals, showcasing the country's athletic prowess. His journey then took him to an art museum, where he stood mesmerized by Picasso's \"The Weeping Woman,\" a painting that spoke volumes about emotion and resilience.\n\nEager to understand the world\u2019s climates, Daniel delved into the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification System, which helped him appreciate the diverse environments he encountered. His thirst for knowledge didn't stop there; he found himself engrossed in Greek mythology, particularly the tale of Tiresias, who revealed the tragic crimes of Oedipus.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Daniel decided to try fishing. A local fisherman taught him how to use a gaff, an iron hook essential for landing heavy fish.

His journey began in Amsterdam, a city rich in history and progressive ideas, famously home to the world\u2019s first birth control clinic. As he wandered the cobblestone streets, he stumbled upon an old theater where he met Phil Silvers, an American actor with a twinkle in his eye. Phil regaled Daniel with tales from his acting days, including the time he replaced Sid James in the film \"Follow That Camel.\"\n\nInspired by Phil's stories, Daniel's curiosity led him to explore more about the world. He read about the 2010 Winter Olympics, where the United States had won an impressive number of medals, showcasing the country's athletic prowess. His journey then took him to an art museum, where he stood mesmerized by Picasso's \"The Weeping Woman,\" a painting that spoke volumes about emotion and resilience.\n\nEager to understand the world\u2019s climates, Daniel delved into the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification System, which helped him appreciate the diverse environments he encountered. His thirst for knowledge didn't stop there; he found himself engrossed in Greek mythology, particularly the tale of Tiresias, who revealed the tragic crimes of Oedipus.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Daniel decided to try fishing. A local fisherman taught him how to use a gaff, an iron hook essential for landing heavy fish. As he fished, he listened to the soothing tunes of Cat Stevens, marveling at how the singer had penned \"Here Comes My Baby\" at just eighteen.\n\nIn the evenings, Daniel enjoyed watching classic TV shows.

His human friend, a passionate football player, was suffering from it. Determined to help, Louie delved into the history of football and discovered that the UEFA, the governing body of European football, was founded in Switzerland in 1954. He shared this tidbit with his friend, hoping to lift his spirits.\n\nLouie's curiosity didn't stop there. He stumbled upon a 1968 film called \"Barbarella,\" which inspired the name of the English band Duran Duran. This discovery led him to explore more music, and he soon found himself dancing to the tunes of The Specials, with Terry Hall as their lead singer. Louie couldn't resist sharing this music with his fellow Cabbage Patch Kids, who quickly became fans.\n\nIn his quest for knowledge, Louie also learned about the legendary Elvis Presley and his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, whose real name was Andreas Cornelis van Kujik. Louie loved telling stories about Elvis and his manager, captivating his friends with tales of rock 'n' roll.\n\nLouie's adventurous spirit longed for travel, and he dreamed of riding the Transandine Railway between Chile and Argentina. He imagined the breathtaking views and the thrill of crossing the Andes.\n\nHis interest in human culture extended to the military, where he discovered that a bombardier was equivalent to a corporal. Louie found this fascinating and often shared his newfound knowledge with anyone who would listen.\n\nOne evening, Louie was enchanted by the unfinished opera \"Turandot\" by Giacomo Puccini and the play \"The Iceman Cometh\" by Eugene O'Neill. These stories fueled his imagination, and he decided to embark on an adventure of his own.\n\nInspired by characters like King Louie, Akela, and Ziggy from Disney's \"The Jungle Book,\" Louie gathered his friends for a journey through the Cabbage Patch.

The villain, known as \"The Scientist,\" had been conducting experiments on the meibomian gland, a part of the human eyelid, to create a mind-control serum.\n\nAs the Turtles prepared for their mission, they were joined by a new ally, a skilled swimmer named Rebecca, who had won Olympic Gold Medals in 2008 in the 400 and 800 m freestyle. Her agility and speed were unmatched, making her a valuable addition to the team.\n\nThe Turtles received a cryptic message with the code word \"India,\" indicating the location of The Scientist's hideout. With the help of Donatello's tech skills, they deciphered the message, which led them to a passage in Norman Mailer's \"The Naked and the Dead,\" hinting at the villain's next move.\n\nMeanwhile, Michelangelo befriended a local writer named Frankie, whose parents, Malachy and Angela, had inspired his tales of resilience and humor. Frankie shared a story about a magical unicorn from Wolf Mankowitz's novel \"A Kid For Two Farthings,\" which sparked an idea for the Turtles' plan.\n\nAs they infiltrated the dam, Leonardo recalled a lesson about Robert Walpole, Britain's first Prime Minister, and his strategic mind, which helped them outsmart The Scientist's traps. In a nostalgic moment, Raphael found an old issue of \"The Eagle,\" a British children's comic from April 1950, which reminded him of their own adventures.\n\nWith teamwork and clever tactics, the Turtles and Rebecca managed to thwart The Scientist's plans, ensuring the safety of the city once again.

The villain, known as \"The Scientist,\" had been conducting experiments on the meibomian gland, a part of the human eyelid, to create a mind-control serum.\n\nAs the Turtles prepared for their mission, they were joined by a new ally, a skilled swimmer named Rebecca, who had won Olympic Gold Medals in 2008 in the 400 and 800 m freestyle. Her agility and speed were unmatched, making her a valuable addition to the team.\n\nThe Turtles received a cryptic message with the code word \"India,\" indicating the location of The Scientist's hideout. With the help of Donatello's tech skills, they deciphered the message, which led them to a passage in Norman Mailer's \"The Naked and the Dead,\" hinting at the villain's next move.\n\nMeanwhile, Michelangelo befriended a local writer named Frankie, whose parents, Malachy and Angela, had inspired his tales of resilience and humor. Frankie shared a story about a magical unicorn from Wolf Mankowitz's novel \"A Kid For Two Farthings,\" which sparked an idea for the Turtles' plan.\n\nAs they infiltrated the dam, Leonardo recalled a lesson about Robert Walpole, Britain's first Prime Minister, and his strategic mind, which helped them outsmart The Scientist's traps. In a nostalgic moment, Raphael found an old issue of \"The Eagle,\" a British children's comic from April 1950, which reminded him of their own adventures.\n\nWith teamwork and clever tactics, the Turtles and Rebecca managed to thwart The Scientist's plans, ensuring the safety of the city once again. As they celebrated their victory, they knew that their bond and shared knowledge would always guide them through any challenge."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos":

One day, he received a mysterious invitation to a tournament titled \"The King of Barataria.\" Intrigued, Yugi set off to the mystical land where the tournament was to be held. This land was a melting pot of cultures and beliefs, where followers of various religions, including Rastafarianism with its Sufferers, Locksmen, and Dreads, gathered in harmony.\n\nThe tournament promised a grand prize: a rare card adorned with two stars, reminiscent of the national flag of Syria. As Yugi prepared for his first duel, he encountered a fellow duelist who had Duane Syndrome, a condition affecting their eye movements. Despite this challenge, the duelist's skills were formidable, reminding Yugi of the importance of perseverance.\n\nDuring the tournament, Yugi faced a shadow duel that forced him to confront his deepest fear: taphephobia, the fear of being buried alive. Drawing strength from his past victories, Yugi overcame the fear, emerging victorious.\n\nA subplot revealed that Yugi's ancestor had lived during the time of Louis XV, the great-grandson of the illustrious Louis XIV. This connection to history gave Yugi a sense of pride and determination.\n\nSeeking guidance, Yugi visited a wise druid named Getafix, from the village in the Asterix comics. Getafix provided Yugi with a potion to enhance his focus and strategy, crucial for the upcoming duels.\n\nThe tournament took place in Lincolnshire, the birthplace of the formidable former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. The event was orchestrated by a mysterious figure whose style and presence were reminiscent of John Huston, the legendary director of \"The Maltese Falcon.\"\n\nAs the tournament reached its climax, Yugi found inspiration in the stories of two British athletes from \"Chariots of Fire.\" Their determination and spirit fueled Yugi's resolve as he faced the final duel.

One day, he received a mysterious invitation to a tournament titled \"The King of Barataria.\" Intrigued, Yugi set off to the mystical land where the tournament was to be held. This land was a melting pot of cultures and beliefs, where followers of various religions, including Rastafarianism with its Sufferers, Locksmen, and Dreads, gathered in harmony.\n\nThe tournament promised a grand prize: a rare card adorned with two stars, reminiscent of the national flag of Syria. As Yugi prepared for his first duel, he encountered a fellow duelist who had Duane Syndrome, a condition affecting their eye movements. Despite this challenge, the duelist's skills were formidable, reminding Yugi of the importance of perseverance.\n\nDuring the tournament, Yugi faced a shadow duel that forced him to confront his deepest fear: taphephobia, the fear of being buried alive. Drawing strength from his past victories, Yugi overcame the fear, emerging victorious.\n\nA subplot revealed that Yugi's ancestor had lived during the time of Louis XV, the great-grandson of the illustrious Louis XIV. This connection to history gave Yugi a sense of pride and determination.\n\nSeeking guidance, Yugi visited a wise druid named Getafix, from the village in the Asterix comics. Getafix provided Yugi with a potion to enhance his focus and strategy, crucial for the upcoming duels.\n\nThe tournament took place in Lincolnshire, the birthplace of the formidable former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. The event was orchestrated by a mysterious figure whose style and presence were reminiscent of John Huston, the legendary director of \"The Maltese Falcon.\"\n\nAs the tournament reached its climax, Yugi found inspiration in the stories of two British athletes from \"Chariots of Fire.\" Their determination and spirit fueled Yugi's resolve as he faced the final duel. With strategic brilliance and unwavering courage, Yugi triumphed, claiming the rare card and the title of \"The King of Barataria.\""], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos":

Dan learns that the Bakugan is hidden in a place related to Poopdeck Pappy, the father of Popeye.\n4. He discovers that the Bakugan is located near a dartboard, specifically between the numbers 4 and 6.\n5. Dan encounters a guardian who challenges him with a question about the last Catholic monarch of England, James II.\n6. To proceed, Dan must play a game of Shanghai on a dartboard.\n7.

He receives help from a wise old man who resembles Lyndon B. Johnson, JFK's Vice President.\n10. The final clue is linked to the novel \"The Eagle Has Landed\" by Jack Higgins, leading Dan to the Zugspitze in Germany.\n\nStory:\nIn the vibrant world of Bakugan, Dan Kuso was known for his adventurous spirit and unparalleled brawling skills. One day, he embarked on a quest to find a legendary Bakugan rumored to possess extraordinary powers. His journey led him to a quaint village in the UK, where he met two lively dancing instructors, Barry and Yvonne. They were renowned for their roles in the television series \"Hi De Hi,\" and they had a penchant for solving mysteries.\n\nBarry and Yvonne, intrigued by Dan's quest, shared a cryptic clue: \"Seek the sailor's legacy, where numbers dance between four and six.\" Dan pondered over the clue, realizing it referred to Poopdeck Pappy, the father of the fictional sailor Popeye. His search led him to a local pub, where a dartboard held the key to the next step of his journey.\n\nAs Dan examined the dartboard, he noticed the numbers 4 and 6, and in between them lay the number 5. Just then, a mysterious guardian appeared, challenging Dan with a question: \"Who was the last Catholic monarch to reign over England?\" Dan confidently answered, \"James II,\" and the guardian allowed him to proceed.\n\nThe next challenge was a game of Shanghai on the dartboard. Dan's precision and skill earned him victory, revealing a hidden compartment with a scroll. The scroll mentioned Tewkesbury Mustard, a reference from Shakespeare's \"Henry IV, Part 2.\" This clue led Dan to a library, where he discovered a puzzle involving the square root of 169. With a quick calculation, he solved it: 13.\n\nIn the library, Dan encountered a wise old man who bore a striking resemblance to Lyndon B. Johnson, the Vice President under John F. Kennedy. The old man offered sage advice, guiding Dan to the final clue: a novel titled \"The Eagle Has Landed\" by Jack Higgins.

One day, he embarked on a quest to find a legendary Bakugan rumored to possess extraordinary powers. His journey led him to a quaint village in the UK, where he met two lively dancing instructors, Barry and Yvonne. They were renowned for their roles in the television series \"Hi De Hi,\" and they had a penchant for solving mysteries.\n\nBarry and Yvonne, intrigued by Dan's quest, shared a cryptic clue: \"Seek the sailor's legacy, where numbers dance between four and six.\" Dan pondered over the clue, realizing it referred to Poopdeck Pappy, the father of the fictional sailor Popeye. His search led him to a local pub, where a dartboard held the key to the next step of his journey.\n\nAs Dan examined the dartboard, he noticed the numbers 4 and 6, and in between them lay the number 5. Just then, a mysterious guardian appeared, challenging Dan with a question: \"Who was the last Catholic monarch to reign over England?\" Dan confidently answered, \"James II,\" and the guardian allowed him to proceed.\n\nThe next challenge was a game of Shanghai on the dartboard. Dan's precision and skill earned him victory, revealing a hidden compartment with a scroll. The scroll mentioned Tewkesbury Mustard, a reference from Shakespeare's \"Henry IV, Part 2.\" This clue led Dan to a library, where he discovered a puzzle involving the square root of 169. With a quick calculation, he solved it: 13.\n\nIn the library, Dan encountered a wise old man who bore a striking resemblance to Lyndon B. Johnson, the Vice President under John F. Kennedy. The old man offered sage advice, guiding Dan to the final clue: a novel titled \"The Eagle Has Landed\" by Jack Higgins. Within its pages, Dan found a map leading to the Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany.\n\nWith all the clues pieced together, Dan journeyed to the majestic Zugspitze.

As she read about the catastrophic event, her emotions marveled at the power of nature. \"Wow, that's intense!\" exclaimed Joy, her eyes wide with wonder.\n\nLater, Riley took a break to watch an episode of \"The Simpsons,\" featuring the quirky animals Blinky, Mr. Teeny, and Jub-Jub. The antics of the characters brought laughter to the headquarters, with Joy bouncing around in delight. \"I love these guys!\" she giggled.\n\nRiley's interest then shifted to political philosophy as she delved into Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's \"The Prince,\" published in 1532. The treatise sparked a lively debate among her emotions about power and morality. \"It's all about strategy,\" Anger insisted, while Sadness pondered the ethical implications.\n\nIn the evening, Riley settled in for a movie marathon featuring Jack Nicholson, watching \"Ironweed,\" \"The Pledge,\" and \"Easy Rider.\" The films captivated her, and her emotions were swept up in the drama and intensity of Nicholson's performances.\n\nInspired by her studies, Riley decided to conduct a science experiment, reminiscent of Benjamin Franklin's famous kite experiment in 1750. Fear was a bit apprehensive, but Joy encouraged Riley's scientific curiosity.\n\nAs Riley organized her calendar, she noted that March was the third month alphabetically, a small but satisfying detail that brought a smile to her face.\n\nHer exploration of Greek mythology led her to the Erinyes, the avenging deities. The story of these fearsome figures intrigued her emotions, with Disgust shuddering at their relentless pursuit of justice.\n\nAt a meeting, Riley learned about the Chatham House Rule, a principle that ensures the confidentiality of information sources.

Her emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust\u2014watched eagerly from their headquarters, ready to dive into whatever new interest Riley had discovered.\n\nToday, Riley was fascinated by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, believed to be the largest single explosion in recorded human history. As she read about the catastrophic event, her emotions marveled at the power of nature. \"Wow, that's intense!\" exclaimed Joy, her eyes wide with wonder.\n\nLater, Riley took a break to watch an episode of \"The Simpsons,\" featuring the quirky animals Blinky, Mr. Teeny, and Jub-Jub. The antics of the characters brought laughter to the headquarters, with Joy bouncing around in delight. \"I love these guys!\" she giggled.\n\nRiley's interest then shifted to political philosophy as she delved into Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's \"The Prince,\" published in 1532. The treatise sparked a lively debate among her emotions about power and morality. \"It's all about strategy,\" Anger insisted, while Sadness pondered the ethical implications.\n\nIn the evening, Riley settled in for a movie marathon featuring Jack Nicholson, watching \"Ironweed,\" \"The Pledge,\" and \"Easy Rider.\" The films captivated her, and her emotions were swept up in the drama and intensity of Nicholson's performances.\n\nInspired by her studies, Riley decided to conduct a science experiment, reminiscent of Benjamin Franklin's famous kite experiment in 1750. Fear was a bit apprehensive, but Joy encouraged Riley's scientific curiosity.\n\nAs Riley organized her calendar, she noted that March was the third month alphabetically, a small but satisfying detail that brought a smile to her face.\n\nHer exploration of Greek mythology led her to the Erinyes, the avenging deities. The story of these fearsome figures intrigued her emotions, with Disgust shuddering at their relentless pursuit of justice.\n\nAt a meeting, Riley learned about the Chatham House Rule, a principle that ensures the confidentiality of information sources.

Sing's favorite movie series is \"Back to the Future,\" and he dreams of traveling to 1885 like Michael J. Fox.\n\nStory:\nSing was a man of many interests, a passionate historian and trivia enthusiast who spent his days immersed in books and documentaries. As he prepared for an upcoming trivia competition, his mind was a whirlwind of facts and figures. One of his favorite topics was cricket, and he marveled at the legendary Ian Botham, who in June 1978 became the first cricketer to score a century and take eight wickets in one inning in a Test Match.\n\nAt home, Sing was never alone. His pet skunk, a female named Jessica, kept him company.

With a knowing gaze, Barney led the explorers through a secret passage, guiding them to safety and the promise of new discoveries.\n\nIn the end, the explorers realized that their journey was not just about uncovering artifacts but also about the stories and connections that transcended time, linking them to a world long forgotten."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which country was formerly known by the Greeks as Tylos?", "Who played Margo Channing in the 1950 film \u2018All About Eve\u2019?", "Who is the host of the BBC television show QI?", "What is the name of the cockerel in the UK television series \u2018The Good Life\u2019?", "In humans, Gorham disease affects which part of the body?", "Which English Rugby Union team play their home games at Adams Park?", "In the UK television series \u2018Dad\u2019s Army\u2019, what was Lance-Corpopal Jack Jones occupation?", "What is the name of the fictional club in the James Bond novel \u2018Moonraker\u2019?", "Who published a 1754 book of his designs entitled \u2018The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker\u2019s Director\u2019?", "Barney the Owl is a mascot of which English football club?"], "answers": [["Asia/Bahrain", "\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "Bahrein", "Bahrayn", "Dawlat al-Bahrain", "Bahrein Islands", "Etymology of Bahrain", "Bahrain", "Bahrain islands", "Bahraih", "\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "Languages of Bahrain", "Emirate of Bahrain", "ISO 3166-1:BH", "Bahrain Islands", "Mamlakat al-Ba\u1e25rayn", "Bahrain's", "Bahrain/Geography", "Al-Ba\u1e25rayn", "Barhain", "Kingdom of Bahrain", "1923 Sitrah Outrage", "Al-Bahrayn", "iso 3166 1 bh", "bahrain", "barhain", "bahrayn", "languages of bahrain", "al ba\u1e25rayn", "emirate of bahrain", "mamlakat al ba\u1e25rayn", "bahrain geography", "dawlat al bahrain", "etymology of bahrain", "bahrein islands", "bahrain s", "\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "1923 sitrah outrage", "bahrain islands", "asia bahrain", "bahrein", "kingdom of bahrain", "al bahrayn", "\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "bahraih"], ["Ruth Davis", "Arthur Farnsworth.", "Harmon Nelson", "Davis, Bette", "Bette Davies", "Arthur Farnsworth (Bette Davis' husband)", "Ruth Elizabeth Davis", "Bette Davis", "Ruth Elizabeth %22Bette%22 Davis", "Bettie Davis", "ruth davis", "arthur farnsworth", "arthur farnsworth bette davis husband", "bettie davis", "davis bette", "ruth elizabeth 22bette 22 davis", "ruth elizabeth davis", "bette davies", "harmon nelson", "bette davis"], ["Stephen Fry", "Stephen fry", "Steven fry", "Steve Fry", "@stephenfry", "Steven Fry", "Rescuing the Spectacled Bear", "stephen fry", "stephenfry", "rescuing spectacled bear", "steven fry", "steve fry"], ["N.

Setting: A fictional world where bugs participate in an annual event similar to the World Bog Snorkelling Championships, held in a European-inspired bug country.\n2. Main Character: A bug named Olympus, inspired by the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons on Mars.\n3. Supporting Characters: Dr. Finlay, a wise old bug who offers advice; a group of bugs named after the founders of JCB, Joseph and Cyril; and a bug named Black Beauty, known for its elegance.\n4. Plot: Olympus, the main character, is preparing for the annual bug snorkelling championship. He seeks advice from Dr. Finlay and teams up with Joseph and Cyril.\n5. Conflict: Olympus faces challenges during the championship, including a rival bug named Bond, inspired by the second James Bond film, \"From Russia with Love.\"\n6. Resolution: Olympus overcomes the challenges with the help of his friends and wins the championship.\n7. Themes: Friendship, perseverance, and the spirit of competition.\n\nStory:\nIn the heart of the lush, green meadows of Buglandia, an annual event was about to take place\u2014the World Bog Snorkelling Championships. This was no ordinary competition; it was a test of skill and endurance, held in the picturesque bug country reminiscent of Wales. Bugs from all over the land gathered to witness the spectacle, and among them was a determined young bug named Olympus.\n\nOlympus was named after the largest known volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons on Mars, and he carried the spirit of a giant within his tiny frame. As the championship approached, Olympus sought the wisdom of Dr. Finlay, a venerable old bug known for his sage advice. Dr. Finlay, inspired by the Scottish physician and novelist who created him, offered Olympus words of encouragement and a strategy to tackle the challenges ahead.\n\nJoining Olympus were his steadfast friends, Joseph and Cyril, named after the founders of the British company JCB. Together, they formed a formidable team, ready to face any obstacle. Their journey was not without its hurdles, as they encountered a rival bug named Bond, whose cunning was as sharp as the plot of the second James Bond film, \"From Russia with Love.\"\n\nAs the championship commenced, Olympus and his friends navigated the bog with precision, their path marked by the double-word score squares of a Scrabble board, each step a calculated move.

This was no ordinary competition; it was a test of skill and endurance, held in the picturesque bug country reminiscent of Wales. Bugs from all over the land gathered to witness the spectacle, and among them was a determined young bug named Olympus.\n\nOlympus was named after the largest known volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons on Mars, and he carried the spirit of a giant within his tiny frame. As the championship approached, Olympus sought the wisdom of Dr. Finlay, a venerable old bug known for his sage advice. Dr. Finlay, inspired by the Scottish physician and novelist who created him, offered Olympus words of encouragement and a strategy to tackle the challenges ahead.\n\nJoining Olympus were his steadfast friends, Joseph and Cyril, named after the founders of the British company JCB. Together, they formed a formidable team, ready to face any obstacle. Their journey was not without its hurdles, as they encountered a rival bug named Bond, whose cunning was as sharp as the plot of the second James Bond film, \"From Russia with Love.\"\n\nAs the championship commenced, Olympus and his friends navigated the bog with precision, their path marked by the double-word score squares of a Scrabble board, each step a calculated move. Along the way, they were inspired by the elegance of Black Beauty, a bug known for its grace, much like the horse in Anna Sewell's novel.\n\nThe competition was fierce, and the fictitious station of Walford East, a nod to the UK television series 'Eastenders', served as a metaphorical checkpoint in their journey.

There, he discovered an old boutique, reminiscent of the one run by Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, known as \"SEX.\" Inside, he found a vintage jacket with a hidden pocket containing another map fragment.\n\nThis fragment referenced \"Tristram Shandy,\" the 18th Century novel by Lawrence Sterne, published in nine volumes. Aladdin's love for literature guided him to a library in Manchester, where he found a rare edition of the book with a note tucked inside.\n\nThe note mentioned the Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower, which became the tallest building in the world in 1973. Aladdin's journey took him to Chicago, where he ascended the tower and found a hidden compartment in the observation deck.\n\nInside was a copy of \"Carrie,\" Stephen King's first novel published under his own name. The book contained a map leading to the final destination: the tomb of Philippa of Hainault, wife of Edward III, in Westminster Abbey.\n\nAs Aladdin stood before the tomb, he recalled the infamous Great Train Robbery, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, who referred to it as his \"Sistine Chapel ceiling.\" The final clue was a nod to the artistry and precision required to pull off such a heist.\n\nWith all the pieces in place, Aladdin uncovered a hidden chamber beneath the tomb, revealing a treasure trove of historical artifacts. As he marveled at the discovery, he reflected on the journey that had brought him here\u2014a journey through history, culture, and his own fears. Aladdin realized that the true treasure was not the artifacts themselves, but the stories they told and the adventures they inspired."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos":

Mulan uses a Catherine Wheel firework to defeat Azal.\n11. Mulan solves the final puzzle using the number 12.\n\nStory:\nIn a land where legends and reality intertwined, Mulan embarked on a quest to save her village from the dark sorcery of Azal, a fearsome villain known for his mastery of forbidden magic. Azal was aided by his loyal gargoyle servant, Bok, who watched over the enchanted forest with eyes of stone.\n\nAs Mulan ventured deeper into the woods, she stumbled upon a peculiar object\u2014a magical Rubik\u2019s Cube, each side adorned with nine squares. The cube glowed with an ethereal light, hinting at its potential to unlock secrets of the universe. Intrigued, Mulan tucked it into her satchel, sensing it would be crucial in her journey.\n\nHer path soon led her to the Brockman family, a lively group known for their wit and humor. The Brockmans, with their surname echoing through the village, offered Mulan shelter and shared tales of their own adventures. Their stories filled Mulan with courage and laughter, fortifying her resolve.\n\nContinuing her journey, Mulan encountered a louvar, a mystical fish with shimmering scales that danced like moonlight on water. The louvar spoke in riddles, guiding Mulan to seek wisdom from the past. It whispered of Queen Joan of Navarre, the stepmother of King Henry V, who had once been imprisoned for witchcraft. Mulan pondered the lessons of history, understanding the power of resilience and justice.\n\nHer travels brought her face to face with a trio of squirrels: the Grizzled Giant, Southern Flying, and Provost\u2019s. These creatures, each with their unique abilities, challenged Mulan to think creatively and adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Through their trials, Mulan honed her skills and learned the value of teamwork.\n\nIn a moment of reflection, Mulan met a wise figure named Andrew Bonar Law, who imparted sage advice. His words resonated with her, reminding her of the importance of leadership and determination.\n\nAs dusk fell, Mulan discovered a magical book, its pages alive with the adventures of Emelius Browne, Mr. Jelk, and Colonel Heller from the enchanting world of \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks.\" The stories within inspired Mulan, filling her with a sense of wonder and possibility.\n\nArmed with newfound knowledge and courage, Mulan confronted Azal. In a climactic battle, she wielded a Catherine Wheel firework, its fiery spirals reminiscent of the ancient instrument of torture. The explosive display dazzled and disoriented Azal, giving Mulan the upper hand.\n\nFinally, Mulan faced the ultimate challenge\u2014a puzzle that required the square root of 144.

Azal was aided by his loyal gargoyle servant, Bok, who watched over the enchanted forest with eyes of stone.\n\nAs Mulan ventured deeper into the woods, she stumbled upon a peculiar object\u2014a magical Rubik\u2019s Cube, each side adorned with nine squares. The cube glowed with an ethereal light, hinting at its potential to unlock secrets of the universe. Intrigued, Mulan tucked it into her satchel, sensing it would be crucial in her journey.\n\nHer path soon led her to the Brockman family, a lively group known for their wit and humor. The Brockmans, with their surname echoing through the village, offered Mulan shelter and shared tales of their own adventures. Their stories filled Mulan with courage and laughter, fortifying her resolve.\n\nContinuing her journey, Mulan encountered a louvar, a mystical fish with shimmering scales that danced like moonlight on water. The louvar spoke in riddles, guiding Mulan to seek wisdom from the past. It whispered of Queen Joan of Navarre, the stepmother of King Henry V, who had once been imprisoned for witchcraft. Mulan pondered the lessons of history, understanding the power of resilience and justice.\n\nHer travels brought her face to face with a trio of squirrels: the Grizzled Giant, Southern Flying, and Provost\u2019s. These creatures, each with their unique abilities, challenged Mulan to think creatively and adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Through their trials, Mulan honed her skills and learned the value of teamwork.\n\nIn a moment of reflection, Mulan met a wise figure named Andrew Bonar Law, who imparted sage advice. His words resonated with her, reminding her of the importance of leadership and determination.\n\nAs dusk fell, Mulan discovered a magical book, its pages alive with the adventures of Emelius Browne, Mr. Jelk, and Colonel Heller from the enchanting world of \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks.\" The stories within inspired Mulan, filling her with a sense of wonder and possibility.\n\nArmed with newfound knowledge and courage, Mulan confronted Azal. In a climactic battle, she wielded a Catherine Wheel firework, its fiery spirals reminiscent of the ancient instrument of torture. The explosive display dazzled and disoriented Azal, giving Mulan the upper hand.\n\nFinally, Mulan faced the ultimate challenge\u2014a puzzle that required the square root of 144. With a confident smile, she declared the answer: 12. The magical Rubik\u2019s Cube responded, unlocking a portal that banished Azal and restored peace to the land.\n\nVictorious, Mulan returned to her village, celebrated as a hero.

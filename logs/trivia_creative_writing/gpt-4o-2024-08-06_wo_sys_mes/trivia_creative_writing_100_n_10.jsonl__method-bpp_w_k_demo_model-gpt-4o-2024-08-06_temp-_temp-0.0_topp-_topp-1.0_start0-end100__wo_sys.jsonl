As he marveled at the innovation, he overheard a conversation about Stansfield Turner, who would later become the director of the CIA from 1976-81.\n\nMario's journey continued as he wandered into a theater playing 'My Fair Lady,' enchanted by the song 'The Street Where You Live.' Inspired, he decided to explore more of the city's history. He stumbled upon a secret archive detailing the failed 'Bomb Plot' of 1944 against Adolf Hitler.\n\nLater, Mario attended a concert where Richard Marx performed his 80s hit 'Hold On To The Nights.' The music reminded him of the classic western 'Stagecoach,' directed by John Ford, which he had watched as a child.\n\nHis adventure took a musical turn when he discovered a vinyl of Bob Dylan's 'Highway 61 Revisited' and learned about Pink Floyd, the legendary rock group featuring Dave Gilmour and Roger Waters.\n\nAs Mario's journey neared its end, he learned about Romania, the only eastern bloc country to participate in the 1984 LA Olympics. Finally, he stumbled upon a screening of 'Wild Palms,' a 90s sci-fi series with James Belushi, based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip.\n\nWith a heart full of stories and a mind buzzing with history, Mario realized that every moment was a piece of a larger puzzle, waiting to be discovered."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In what year's Olympics were electric timing devices and a public-address system used for the first time?", "Who was the director of the CIA from 1976-81?", "Which musical featured the song The Street Where You Live?", "\"Who was the target of the failed \"\"Bomb Plot\"\" of 1944?\"", "Who had an 80s No 1 hit with Hold On To The Nights?", "Who directed the classic 30s western Stagecoach?", "Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters were in which rock group?", "Which highway was Revisited in a classic 60s album by Bob Dylan?", "Which was the only eastern bloc country to participate in the 1984 LA Olympics?", "Which 90s sci fi series with James Belushi was based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip of the same name?"], "answers": [["In 1912, in Stockholm", "in 1912 in stockholm"], ["George Bush", "George bush", "Goerge Bush", "George W.

Her first stop was a magical beach where she met Carl Wilson, the youngest brother of the Beach Boys. Carl taught Dora how to surf the waves of sound, just like his band did with their harmonies.\n\nNext, Dora found herself on the set of Family Feud, hosted by the charming Richard Dawson. She played a game with her friends, learning the importance of being a 'trusted friend,' just like Kemo Sabe, the Lone Ranger's title in Apache.\n\nHer journey continued to a forest where she met Gentle Ben, the friendly bear from the 60s TV series. Ben showed Dora the beauty of nature and the importance of kindness.\n\nDora then traveled to a bustling city, where she discovered All in the Family, a show based on the British series Till Death Us Do Part. She learned about different cultures and how families can be both funny and loving.\n\nSuddenly, Dora was on the Moon, celebrating the historic moment when Neil Armstrong first set foot there on July 20, 1969. She imagined herself bouncing in the low gravity, just like the astronauts.\n\nBack on Earth, Dora danced to the tune of Downtown by Petula Clark, feeling the rhythm of the city. She then found herself at the Monterey Pop Festival, watching in awe as Jimi Hendrix set his guitar on fire, creating a spectacle of sound and light.\n\nIn a quiet moment, Dora visited Perry Mason's office, where she met Della Street, his ever-loyal secretary. Della shared stories of mystery and justice, inspiring Dora to always seek the truth.\n\nFinally, Dora ended her adventure with a concert by Donny Osmond, who sang Sweet and Innocent and Too Young. The music filled her heart with joy, reminding her of the power of song and the innocence of youth."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who was the youngest brother in the Beach Boys?", "Who first hosted Family Feud?", "What did the Lone Ranger's title Kemo Sabe mean in Apache?", "Who or what was Gentle Ben in the 60s TV series?", "Which 70s show was based on the British show Till Death Us Do Part?", "On what date in 1969 did Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon?", "Who had a 60s No 1 with Downtown?", "Who set fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop festival in 19676?", "Della Street was whose secretary?", "In music, who was Sweet and Innocent and Too Young?"], "answers": [["Carl Wilson", "Carl Wilson discography", "Wilson, Carl Dean", "Carl Dean Wilson", "Wilson, Carl", "carl wilson discography", "carl dean wilson", "carl wilson", "wilson carl dean", "wilson carl"], ["Dick Dawson", "Richard Dawson", "Dickie Dawson", "Colin Lionel Emm", "Colin Emm", "colin lionel emm", "richard dawson", "colin emm", "dickie dawson", "dick dawson"], ["L\u00e8ine bh\u00e0n", "White shirt", "White Shirt", "Leine bhan", "l\u00e8ine bh\u00e0n", "white shirt", "leine bhan"], ["Ursine", "Ursoidea", "Honey pig", "Bears", "Arctos", "Ursidae", "BEAR", "Mating bears", "Bear cub", "Reproductive behavior of bears", "Ursoid", "Cub (bear)", "Bear", "\ud83d\udc3b", "Bear (zoology)", "Sexual behavior of bears", "Bear hibernation", "ursidae", "bear cub", "cub bear", "bear hibernation", "ursoidea", "bear", "reproductive behavior of bears", "honey pig", "ursoid", "bears", "mating bears", "ursine", "\ud83d\udc3b", "arctos", "bear zoology", "sexual behavior of bears"], ["All In The Family", "All in the family", "Justice For All (TV pilot)", "Stretch Cunningham", "All in the Family (US series)", "Those Were the Days (TV pilot)", "All In the Family", "Millard Fillmore High School", "All in the Family", "Justice for All (TV pilot)", "Those Were The Days (TV pilot)", "stretch cunningham", "justice for all tv pilot", "all in family us series", "all in family", "those were days tv pilot", "millard fillmore high school"], ["July 20", "20 July", "July 20th", "Jul 20", "20th July", "Historical anniversaries/July 20", "20 july", "jul 20", "historical anniversaries july 20", "july 20th", "july 20", "20th july"], ["Petula Clark", "Petula Clarke", "Pet clark", "Petula Sally Olwen Clark", "petula clarke", "petula sally olwen clark", "pet clark", "petula clark"], ["Hendrix", "Lithofayne Pridgeon", "Jimi hendrix", "Early life of jimi hendrix", "Villanova Junction", "James Marshall Hendrix", "Jimmi Hendrix", "Jimy Hendrix", "Johnny Allen Hendrix", "Jimmy hendrix", "Jimmy Hendricks", "Gypsy Sun and Rainbows", "Jimmy Hendrix", "Electric Church", "Janie Hendrix", "Early life of Jimi Hendrix", "Heaven Research", "Jim Hendrix", "Al Hendrix", "Gypsy Suns and Rainbows", "James Hendrix", "Jimi Hendrix", "johnny allen hendrix", "jimmy hendrix", "jim hendrix", "jimi hendrix", "jimy hendrix", "hendrix", "jimmy hendricks", "early life of jimi hendrix", "electric church", "gypsy suns and rainbows", "heaven research", "villanova junction", "james hendrix", "al hendrix", "james marshall hendrix", "gypsy sun and rainbows", "lithofayne pridgeon", "janie hendrix", "jimmi hendrix"], ["Perry Mason (film)", "Perry mason", "Perry Mason: The Case of the Defiant Daughter", "Perry Mason", "perry mason", "perry mason case of defiant daughter", "perry mason film"], ["Donny Osmond", "Donny & Marie in Las Vegas", "Donald Clark Osmond", "Donald Osmond", "Donnie Osmond", "donald osmond", "donald clark osmond", "donny marie in las vegas", "donnie osmond", "donny osmond"]], "question_ids": ["tc_888", "tc_905", "tc_935", "tc_938", "tc_945", "tc_954", "tc_1004", "tc_1020", "tc_1023", "tc_1028"], "topic": "Dora the Explorer"}}

He had just learned that a mysterious figure named Peter O'Toole was in town, rumored to be connected to a series of strange events.\n\nAs he landed on a rooftop, Spider-Man recalled a conversation with his friend Joely Richardson, who had mentioned her mother, Vanessa Redgrave, was worried about a new threat. Joely had also shared a curious fact about Melanie Molitor, the mother of tennis star Martina Hingis, who had recently visited the city.\n\nSpider-Man's thoughts were interrupted by a news report about a 'house of horrors' in Belgium, linked to a man named Marc Dutroux. The report reminded him of the Ryder Cup, first held in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1927, a symbol of international cooperation.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Spider-Man remembered Woody Herman, who at just 20 years old, had founded his own orchestra, inspiring Spider-Man to trust his instincts and take action.\n\nHis investigation led him to a film screening of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, the movie for which Katharine Hepburn won her second Oscar.

The air was filled with excitement, much like the thrill of a Formula One race, where Mike Hawthorn had triumphed three times. As she pondered the persistence needed to achieve such feats, her thoughts were interrupted by a flood of spam messages on her communicator, reminding her of the digital world's challenges.\n\nLater, she visited the Juilliard School, founded in 1905, to attend a performance. The halls echoed with the legacy of artists, much like Frank Harris's controversial My Life and Loves, which had once been banned. As she walked through the city, she hummed Blondie's 'The Tide Is High,' a reminder of the 80s' vibrant culture.\n\nReflecting on the past, she thought of Anne Bancroft, born in the 1930s, and the timeless influence of icons like Elvis Presley, after whom Cindy Crawford named her son. Her journey took her to an auction where a dress by Catherine Walker, once worn by Princess Diana, fetched a record price.\n\nIn her quest for peace, Wonder Woman met with leaders, recalling Yasser Arafat's role in founding al Fatah in 1957. Her mission was clear: to inspire hope and courage in a world filled with challenges."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which events did Gert Fredriksson win six Olympic gold medals?", "How many of his 45 races did Mike Hawthorn, a former Formula One motor racing world champion, win?", "On the Internet what is Spam?", "In which year was the Juilliard School founded in New York?", "Who wrote My Life and Loves in 1926, originally banned in the US?", "What was Blondie's last UK No 1 of the 80s?", "In which decade of the 20th century was Anne Bancroft born?", "Which rock star did Cindy Crawford name her first son after?", "Who designed the dress which made the most at Diana's dress auction?", "Which Palestinian co-founded al Fatah in 1957?"], "answers": [["Flatwater", "Canoeing", "Canoeist", "Canoers", "Canoe flatwater racing", "Canoing", "Paddler", "Canoer", "Flatwater canoeing", "Competitive canoeing", "canoeing", "canoeist", "canoer", "paddler", "canoe flatwater racing", "canoers", "flatwater", "canoing", "competitive canoeing", "flatwater canoeing"], ["3", "Three", "three", "three", "3"], ["Junk mail (disambiguation)", "Junkmail", "Junkmailing", "Junk mail", "Junk Mail", "junkmail", "junkmailing", "junk mail", "junk mail disambiguation"], ["1905", "one thousand, nine hundred and five", "one thousand nine hundred and five", "1905"], ["Frank Harris", "frank harris"], ["Midtribulation rapture", "Midtribulationism", "Pre-tribulation", "Pre-tribulation rapture", "Rapture", "Pretribulation rapture", "Mid-tribulation rapture", "Rapture (Protestant belief)", "The Teaching of the rapture", "Pretribulationistism", "Pre Tribulation", "Pre-tribulational", "Pre-trib", "teaching of rapture", "pre tribulation rapture", "rapture protestant belief", "midtribulation rapture", "rapture", "pretribulation rapture", "pre tribulational", "mid tribulation rapture", "midtribulationism", "pretribulationistism", "pre trib", "pre tribulation"], ["1930\u2019s", "Thirties", "1930s literature", "Nineteen-thirties", "1930\u20131939", "1930-1939", "'30s", "1930s", "1930's", "%6030s", "1930s (decade)", "The Thirties", "1930\u20131939", "30s", "nineteen thirties", "1930 1939", "thirties", "1930s literature", "1930s decade", "1930s", "1930 s", "6030s"], ["Presley", "Pressley", "Pressly", "pressly", "presley", "pressley"], ["Victor Edelstein", "victor edelstein"], ["Yasir Arafat", "Yasir 'Arafat", "Jassir Arafat", "Abu Ammar", "Yasser 'Arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "Ab\u016b %60amm\u0101r", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat Al Qudua Al Husseini", "Yaser Arafat", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Ashraf al-Kurdi", "Muhammad Abd ar-Rauf al-Qudwah al-Husayni", "Abu Amar", "Mohammed Abdel-Raouf Arafat As Qudwa al-Hussaeini", "Death of yasser arafat", "Yasser Arafet", "Yasser Arafat", "Death Of Yasser Arafat", "Yassir Arafat", "Death of Arafat", "Muhammed al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Yasir Arafat (Disambiguation)", "Illness of Yasser Arafat", "Yassar Arafat", "death of yasser arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "yasir arafat disambiguation", "ab\u016b 60amm\u0101r", "yassir arafat", "illness of yasser arafat", "yassar arafat", "abu ammar", "muhammed al qudwa al husseini", "yasir arafat", "ashraf al kurdi", "muhammad abd ar rauf al qudwah al husayni", "yasser arafet", "yasser arafat", "yaser arafat", "mohammed abdel raouf arafat as qudwa al hussaeini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudua al husseini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudwa al husseini", "death of arafat", "jassir arafat", "abu amar"]], "question_ids": ["tc_1730", "tc_1735", "tc_1754", "tc_1798", "tc_1816", "tc_1826", "tc_1865", "tc_1888", "tc_1921", "tc_1924"], "topic": "Wonder Woman"}}

As he journeyed, he met Baloo, who told him tales of the great musicians of the past, including Ritchie Valens, who once sang to the jungle's rhythm.\n\nMowgli's path led him to a wise old owl named Pablo, who was known for delivering messages across the jungle, much like Il Postino did for the poet Neruda. Pablo spoke of a distant land where a comedian named Jimmy Carr entertained the animals with his humor.\n\nAs Mowgli ventured further, he stumbled upon a game of 'Fort Boyard,' where the jungle creatures tested their skills in physical and mental challenges. Among the contestants was a clever monkey named Max, who reminded Mowgli of the tales of Family Fortunes.\n\nOne night, under the moonlit sky of Uranus, Mowgli gazed at the stars and wondered about the mysteries of the universe, much like Einstein did when he discovered the photoelectric effect. He imagined the moons named after Shakespearean characters, dancing in the sky.\n\nFinally, Mowgli heard the enchanting voice of Miss Piggy, whose songs were said to be dubbed by the legendary Ozzy Osbourne. Her melodies echoed through the jungle, bringing joy to all who listened.\n\nWith each encounter, Mowgli learned more about the world beyond the jungle, realizing that every story, like the Jungle Book itself, was a tapestry of adventures and discoveries."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper were two of the three musicians who died in a plane crash in February 1959.

The Lorax's balls were black and blue, while Castor's were red and yellow, creating a colorful spectacle on the lush green field.\n\nAs they played, the Lorax shared tales of the past.

Gene, the 'meh' Emoji, had discovered an ancient map leading to a legendary artifact known as 'The Grinder.' It was said to grant the power of unwavering determination, much like the famous words of Margaret Thatcher: 'You turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning.'\n\nGene, along with his friends Hi-5 and Jailbreak, embarked on a journey to the Hundred Acre Wood, where the artifact was rumored to be hidden. Their first stop was a snooker hall, where they met a wise old Emoji named Cliff, known as 'The Grinder' for his persistence. Cliff shared tales of a fast bowler named Michael, or 'Whispering Death,' who once guarded the artifact.\n\nAs they traveled through the lush greenery of the Hundred Acre Wood, they encountered Ethel, an Emoji with a dog named Willy. Ethel provided them with a riddle that led them to a quaint village reminiscent of 1979 London, the year Minder first aired.\n\nIn the village, they met Rigsby, a cat Emoji who loved to nap in the sun. Rigsby directed them to a comedy club where they watched a show inspired by 'Till Death Us Do Part' and 'Hancock's Half Hour.' The laughter and camaraderie gave them the final clue they needed.\n\nTheir journey took them to Canada, the birthplace of Bonar Law, where they finally uncovered 'The Grinder' hidden beneath a maple tree. With the artifact in hand, Gene and his friends returned to Textopolis, their adventure a testament to the power of friendship and determination."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following success at the 1979 election whose party conference speeech included the lines 'you turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning'?", "Which snooker player was simply known as 'The Grinder'?", "Which former West Indian fast bowler was known as 'Whispering Death'?", "Which Eastenders character had a dog called Willy?", "In which year did the first episode of Minder take place?", "What was the name of the cat in Rising Damp?", "Which comedy written by Johnny Speight which first aired in 1965, featured a fervent West Ham supporter?", "What was the name of the comedy written by Ray Galton, Alan Simpson which aired 57 episodes?", "Bonar Law is the only Prime Minister not born in the UK.

'Look at all the marine life!' Wanda marveled, as they explored the ocean's depths.\n\nSuddenly, the bus soared into the sky, transforming into Marine One. 'We're flying like the President!' cheered Ralphie, as they learned about this important helicopter.\n\nBack on land, the bus took them to Hever Castle in Kent, where they met Anne Boleyn. 'A real queen!' gasped Phoebe, as they explored the historic castle.\n\nThe bus then traveled to New York City, the capital of the United States from 1785 to 1790. 'So much history in one city!' said Keesha, as they visited famous landmarks.\n\nTheir next stop was St. Trinian's, the fictional girls' boarding school. 'This place is wild!' laughed Tim, as they met the mischievous students.\n\nThe bus then took them to a TV set, where they watched Martin Clunes play Mr. Chips.

Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, and Angelica decided to play 'Time Travelers,' imagining themselves on a magical ship sailing through the mysterious 'Dogger' area, just north of the 'German Bight.'\n\nAs they sailed, they discovered a treasure map with a strange code: 'MIX.' Angelica, always the leader, declared it must be a secret message from 'The Moody Blues,' famous for their magical songs like 'Go Now' and 'Nights in White Satin.'\n\nTheir first stop was a grand castle where they met 'Otto von Bismarck,' the Iron Chancellor. He told them tales of his adventures and gave them a clue about a 'Raven' that once flew from Noah's Ark.\n\nNext, they stumbled upon a band playing music. The drummer, 'Pete Best,' was practicing, but he was soon replaced by a new friend, 'Ringo Starr,' who joined their journey.\n\nSuddenly, the sky darkened, and they found themselves in a royal court. 'Kaiser Wilhelm II' was there, talking about his abdication, just like 'Tsar Nicholas I' had done.\n\nIn a dramatic twist, they met 'Julius Caesar,' who whispered his famous last words, 'Et Tu Brute,' before vanishing into the mist.\n\nTheir final stop was a bustling film studio where 'Charlie Chaplin' was directing a movie. He invited the Rugrats to join his cast, and they all laughed and played until it was time to return home.\n\nAs the sun set, the Rugrats realized their adventure had come to an end, but they knew they'd always have their imaginations to take them on new journeys."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which shipping forecast area is directly north of German Bight?", "What is 1009 when expressed as Roman Numerals?", "Who had hits with Go Now and Nights in White Satin?", "Which statesman was known as the Iron Chancellor?", "What type of bird was the first released by Noah?", "Who was sacked as the Beatles' drummer and replaced by Ringo Starr?", "Tsar Nicholas I abidacated in 1917, who was the other monarch to abdicate during this period?", "Whose last words were Et Tu Brute according to Shakespeare?", "Mel Gibson (1990) and Kenneth Branagh (1996) have both played which character in movies?", "The original United Artists film studio was founded in 1919 by D.W.

She longed for adventure beyond the walls of her castle. One day, she stumbled upon an ancient map that promised a journey through time and space.\n\nHer first stop was the quaint village of Ambridge, where she visited The Bull, a lively pub filled with tales of everyday folk. There, she met a wise bard who spoke of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of a distant king, and her tragic fate.\n\nAs Bride continued her journey, she found herself in a dimly lit room where Christian Slater was interviewing a mysterious vampire. Intrigued, she listened to their tales of immortality and longing.\n\nHer travels then took her to the sunny shores of Key West, the southernmost city in the USA. Here, she marveled at the vibrant culture and warm hospitality.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Bride was swept into a storm and found herself on the magical island from 'The Tempest,' where Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan, shared his wisdom and magic.\n\nHer journey continued as she soared through the skies in a Panavia Tornado, an RAF fighter-bomber, feeling the thrill of flight.\n\nIn a bustling market, she overheard the catchphrases 'Rodney you plonka' and 'This time next year we'll be millionaires,' from a group of jesters reenacting scenes from 'Only Fools and Horses.'\n\nAs the sixth day of her journey dawned, Bride received a gift from her true love: six geese a-laying, a symbol of abundance and joy.\n\nFinally, she witnessed a breathtaking performance by Louis Smith, who dazzled the crowd with his skill on the pommel horse, earning a silver medal.\n\nWith her heart full of stories and experiences, Princess Bride returned to her castle, forever changed by her magical journey."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Captain Corelli's mandolin is a book a film set in which country", "The Bull is the village pub in an everyday tale of country folk.

Legend had it that this coin, a rare twenty pence piece, was hidden by King Charles II himself after he sold Dunkirk to Louis XIV of France.\n\nTheir journey began in a dusty attic, where they discovered an old painting by Peter Blake, 'The First Real Target.' Behind the canvas, they found a map leading to the coin's location. The map was signed by none other than James Byron Dean, a mysterious figure who had once sought the treasure himself.\n\nAs they followed the map, the Goonies stumbled upon a dusty old book of fairy tales by Charles Perrault. The stories of 'Little Red Riding Hood,' 'Sleeping Beauty,' and 'Puss in Boots' seemed to hold clues to the coin's whereabouts.\n\nTheir quest took them across the ocean to South Africa, the birthplace of J.R.R. Tolkien, where they found a hidden message in an ancient manuscript. The message led them to a horse racing track, where they met an old commentator named Peter O\u2019Sullevan, who shared tales of the coin's history.\n\nThe final clue was hidden in the lyrics of an album by The Smiths, 'The Queen is Dead.' The Goonies deciphered the message, which led them to Downing Street, where they uncovered a secret passage beneath the Prime Minister's residence. Margaret Thatcher herself had once called it 'One of the most precious jewels in the national heritage.'\n\nIn the depths of the passage, they encountered Antigonus, a character from Shakespeare's 'The Winter's Tale,' who guarded the treasure. With courage and wit, the Goonies convinced Antigonus to let them pass, and they finally found the Seven-Sided Coin of Dunkirk, completing their incredible adventure."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 10, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In UK currency, how many sides does a twenty pence piece have?", "Which British artist\u2019s works include \u2018The First Real Target\u2019?", "Which King of England sold Dunkirk to Louis XIV of France?", "What was the middle name of US actor James Dean?", "Which French author wrote the fairy tales \u2018Little Red Riding Hood\u2019 \u2018Sleeping Beauty\u2019 and \u2018Puss in Boots\u2019?", "Author J.R.R.

As he read, he imagined himself as a Flemish Baroque painter like Peter Paul Rubens, capturing the essence of these stories on canvas. His mind wandered to the tales of Hans Christian Andersen, the Danish author whose stories he adored as a child.\n\nHans's journey took him further into the world of imagination. He envisioned himself playing a game of Monopoly, the very board game Fidel Castro had ordered to be destroyed. In his mind's eye, he saw a bat, the creature on the Bacardi rum bottle, flitting through the night sky.\n\nAs he continued to read, Hans felt a connection to the apostle John, the only one to witness the crucifixion of Jesus. He imagined himself in ancient Rome, watching John Hurt portray Caligula in 'I, Claudius.' The stories of espionage in John le Carr\u00e9's 'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold' filled his thoughts, and he felt like a mole, or 'Mouldwarp,' burrowing through layers of history and fiction.\n\nFinally, Hans found himself in a smoky caf\u00e9, much like Rick Blaine's in 'Casablanca.' As the music played, he realized that his journey through the pages had transformed him, filling him with a newfound appreciation for the stories that shaped the world."], "parsing_success_flag":

The brain regions will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is one example:\n--- \nExample Task: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid. \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Temporal Lobe; Limbic System; Occipital Lobe; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"We need to organize the poem into seven lines, with the first letters spelling 'CHATGPT.' The language should be simple enough for a ten-year-old, and we need to include basic explanations of quantum computing.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Let\u2019s recall the basics of quantum computing: it\u2019s a type of computer that uses qubits, allowing multiple states at once, unlike classical bits. I\u2019ll provide this key information for the poem.\"\nHippocampus: \"I recall some basic metaphors used in the past to explain complex ideas to children. Let\u2019s use some of those to simplify the explanation.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"We should include vivid imagery to make the poem engaging. For example, comparing qubits to spinning tops or magic coins might help.\"\nLimbic System: \"Let\u2019s ensure the poem is fun and interesting for a child. Using playful words and a light tone will keep them engaged.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the input!

The tone feels lighter and more playful.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"I agree. The explanation is even simpler now, and the playful language makes it more engaging for a child.\"\nHippocampus: \"I like how this reflects previous simple metaphors that work well for children. The playful nature helps.\"\nLimbic System: \"I love the playful tone! It's much more fun and engaging now.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"The imagery is vivid and clear, especially with 'juggling' and 'secrets.' This should help kids visualize the concept better.\"\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine, what a wonder!\nHarnessing strange quantum thunder,\nAtoms play, two states they juggle,\nTaking secrets with a giggle.\n\nGreat at solving, fast and neat,\nPuzzles that no one else can beat,\nTomorrow's future, what a treat!\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

They had discovered an ancient scroll that spoke of a legendary pony named King Henry VII, who founded the Yeomen of the Guard to protect the royal ponies.\n\nExcited by the tale, Rarity decided to design a special outfit inspired by the famous Italian designer Valentino Garavani, who was known for his virtual museum. Meanwhile, Pinkie Pie was busy organizing a royal wedding reenactment, inspired by the marriage of Prince William and Kate.\n\nAs the preparations continued, Fluttershy introduced her new pet, a Labrador Retriever named Marley, who loved to play fetch on Thursdays, or 'Giovedi' as Rarity liked to say in Italian. Rainbow Dash, always up for a challenge, decided to create a starry sky with exactly four stars, just like the flag of New Zealand.\n\nDuring the celebration, Twilight Sparkle shared a fascinating story about Aethra, the first wife of Aegeus, and how she once helped a lost pony find their way home. The ponies laughed and played a game of Bingo, where the number 31, or 'Get up and run,' was the winning call.\n\nAs the day came to an end, Princess Celestia arrived with a special guest, a wise pony from Argentina named Roberto, who shared tales of his homeland and the time when Roberto M.

She packed her favorite book, 'The Lake Isle of Innisfree' by W.B. Yeats, and set off on her journey.\n\nAs she walked, she stumbled upon a mysterious old library. Inside, she found a dusty copy of 'Tender is the Night' by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Intrigued, she sat down to read, imagining herself in the glamorous world of the 1930s.\n\nContinuing her adventure, Strawberry Shortcake met a wise old owl who told her tales of Maria Fitzherbert and her secret marriage to King George IV. Fascinated by history, Strawberry listened intently.\n\nLater, she found herself in a quaint little pub where a dartboard hung on the wall. She learned that the number opposite 4 was 13, a fun fact she tucked away for future trivia games.\n\nIn the evening, Strawberry Shortcake joined a storytelling circle where a bard recited 'The Lady of the Lake' by Sir Walter Scott. The tale of knights and adventure captivated her imagination.\n\nAs night fell, she found a cozy spot to watch her favorite TV series, 'M*A*S*H,' featuring characters like Henry Blake, Charles Winchester, and Father Mulcahy. The humor and camaraderie warmed her heart.\n\nFeeling thirsty, she reached for a can of Sprite, remembering its catchy slogan, 'Obey your thirst.' Refreshed, she continued her journey.\n\nAt a local bingo hall, she learned that 'a crutch and a duck' referred to the number 27. She giggled at the quirky bingo lingo.\n\nIn a nearby market, she discovered different types of potatoes: Spud, Shot, and Hand. She marveled at the variety and imagined all the delicious dishes she could make.\n\nFinally, Strawberry Shortcake met a gamer who told her about 'Metal Gear Solid' and the epic rivalry between Solid Snake and his twin brother, Liquid Snake. The thrilling story of espionage and adventure inspired her to create her own tales.\n\nWith a heart full of stories and a mind buzzing with new knowledge, Strawberry Shortcake returned home, eager to share her adventures with her friends."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which poet wrote \u2018The Lake Isle of Innisfree\u2019?", "Who wrote the 1930\u2019s novel \u2018Tender is the Night\u2019?", "Maria Fitzherbert was \u2018married\u2019 to which British monarch?", "On a standard dartboard, which number lies opposite number 4?", "Who wrote the poem \u2018The Lady of the Lake\u2019?", "Henry Blake, Charles Winchester and Father Mulcahy are all characters in which US tv series?", "\u2018Obey your thirst\u2019 is the advertising slogan for which soft drink?", "\u2018A crutch and a duck\u2019 is the term for which bingo number?", "Spud, Shot and Hand are all types of what?", "In the game \u2018Metal Gear Solid\u2019,who is the twin brother of Solid Snake?"], "answers": [["W.

Yugi, the King of Games, had received a mysterious invitation to a tournament titled 'The King of Barataria.' The tournament was said to be hosted by a secretive group known as the Locksmen, followers of the ancient Rastafarian religion.\n\nAs Yugi arrived at the tournament, he noticed the arena was adorned with red stars, reminiscent of the Syrian flag. The stars seemed to pulse with energy, hinting at the power they held. Among the competitors was a duelist named Duane, who was known for his piercing gaze, a result of his Duane Syndrome.\n\nThe tournament's first challenge was a test of courage, where competitors faced their deepest fears. Yugi's heart raced as he confronted his taphephobia, the fear of being buried alive. But with the spirit of the Pharaoh guiding him, he overcame the challenge.\n\nIn the final duel, Yugi faced a descendant of the great Louis XV, whose deck was as formidable as his royal lineage. The duel was intense, with Yugi drawing inspiration from the wisdom of Getafix, the druid from the tales of Asterix, to outsmart his opponent.\n\nAs the dust settled, Yugi emerged victorious, his triumph echoing the determination of athletes like Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams from 'Chariots of Fire.' The tournament concluded with a celebration in Lincolnshire, the birthplace of the legendary Margaret Thatcher, where Yugi was hailed as the true King of Barataria."], "parsing_success_flag": [true],

She had heard rumors of a mysterious ailment affecting some of the city's residents, known as pyrosis, or heartburn. Determined to help, she enlisted the help of her friend Nick Wilde.\n\nAs they strolled through the vibrant streets, they passed a food stall selling shashlik, the delicious aroma wafting through the air. Nick couldn't resist grabbing a skewer, joking that it was his 'torch of freedom' for the day.\n\nTheir investigation led them to a wise old hedgehog named Yona, who lived on the outskirts of the city. Yona shared tales of the past, including the time when Edward Heath, a notable leader, visited Zootopia and marveled at its harmony.\n\nJudy and Nick's journey took them to the desert district, where they encountered a Bactrian camel with two humps. The camel warned them of a peculiar fear spreading among the citizens\u2014ommatophobia, the fear of eyes.\n\nTheir next stop was the library, where they found a dusty old copy of 'Bleak House' by Charles Dickens. Inside, they discovered a clue left by Inspector Bucket, leading them to the heart of the mystery.\n\nAs they pieced together the puzzle, they met Danny Baldwin, a charming factory boss who had recently moved to Zootopia. He shared stories of his time in 'Coronation Street' and offered his assistance.\n\nFinally, they visited the PDSA, founded by the compassionate Maria Dickin, where they found the cure for the mysterious ailment. With the city's residents now at ease, Judy and Nick celebrated their success, knowing they had once again made Zootopia a better place."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 6, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In medicine, pyrosis is the technical term for which condition?", "Shashlik is what type of food dish?", "Psychoanalyst A A Brill described what as \u2018Torches of Freedom\u2019 in the 1920\u2019s, as symbols of equality for women?", "In the novel \u2018Watership Down\u2019, Yona is what type of creature?", "Who became leader of the British Conservative Party in July 1965?", "What type of camel has two humps?", "Ommatophobia is the irrational fear of which part of the body?", "Inspector Bucket is a character in which novel by Charles Dickens?", "Who played factory boss Danny Baldwin in the British television soap \u2018Coronation Street\u2019?", "Maria Dickin was the founder of which British animal charity in 1917?"], "answers": [["Cardiac passion", "Acid indigestion", "Cardiacus dolor", "Heartburn", "Cardialgia", "Heart burn", "Agita", "Functional heartburn", "Cardialgy", "Ardor ventriculi", "cardialgia", "cardiacus dolor", "heart burn", "cardiac passion", "agita", "heartburn", "acid indigestion", "ardor ventriculi", "cardialgy", "functional heartburn"], ["Chenjeh Kebab", "Kebob", "Chapli kebab", "Testi Kebab", "Kakori Kebab", "Burrah Kebab", "Kababs", "Shish-kebab", "Kalmi Kebab", "Sultan's Feast", "Kalmi", "Kebabs", "Shish kebob", "Shishkabob", "Shishkebab", "Chapli Kebab", "Kabab", "Kabab Bakhtiari", "Qabab", "Kalmi kebab", "Kebab Kenjeh \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647", "Chelow Kebab", "Testi", "Iranian kabab", "Kabob", "Burrah", "Kabaab", "Bihari kebab", "Chapli kabab", "Sheesh kebab", "Steam kebab", "Shish kabob", "Shish-kabob", "Kebab", "Galouti", "Kebap", "Chapli Kabab", "Galouti Kebab", "Kebab restaurant", "shish kebob", "kebab kenjeh \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647", "kebob", "chapli kabab", "shish kabob", "kakori kebab", "kebab", "burrah", "steam kebab", "sultan s feast", "bihari kebab", "galouti kebab", "kababs", "kabab bakhtiari", "iranian kabab", "kabab", "kebabs", "sheesh kebab", "chapli kebab", "chenjeh kebab", "testi kebab", "kebap", "shish kebab", "kabob", "kalmi kebab", "kalmi", "testi", "shishkebab", "kebab restaurant", "burrah kebab", "galouti", "qabab", "chelow kebab", "shishkabob", "kabaab"], ["Ccigarette", "Cigarrette", "Cigarette butts", "Cigaretes", "Cciggarete", "European cigarettes", "Full flavor (cigarette type)", "Sickarette", "Full flavored cigarettes", "Ciggie", "Cigarette end", "Cigarete", "Cigerette", "Ciggy", "100mm cigarette", "Cigarette", "Fag (cigarette)", "Full Flavor (cigarette type)", "Cigarette tube", "Lung rocket", "Cigarrete", "Cigaret", "Cig", "Coffin Nail", "Cigarette litter", "Smokes", "Cigarettes", "Cancer stick", "Cigs", "Cancer Stick", "Cigarette ash", "Loosey", "Ciggarette", "Tobacco cigarette", "Cigerettes", "Dog end", "Cigarette butt", "ciggy", "loosey", "cigarrete", "cigarettes", "cigarette litter", "lung rocket", "ccigarette", "smokes", "cigerette", "ciggarette", "ciggie", "fag cigarette", "cigs", "full flavored cigarettes", "cigarete", "cigaretes", "european cigarettes", "dog end", "cigarette", "cigarette tube", "cigarette butts", "cigerettes", "cigarette butt", "100mm cigarette", "cigaret", "coffin nail", "cigarette ash", "cigarette end", "sickarette", "tobacco cigarette", "cciggarete", "full flavor cigarette type", "cig", "cigarrette", "cancer stick"], ["Domestic Hedgehog", "Hedgepig", "Erinaceinae", "Hedge hog", "Hedge Hog", "Hedgehogs", "Hedgehog", "hedgepig", "domestic hedgehog", "hedgehogs", "erinaceinae", "hedge hog", "hedgehog"], ["Sir Edward Heath", "Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath II", "Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath (1974\u20131975)", "Edward Heath", "Edward Richard George Heath", "Ted Heath", "Edward R.

Her journey took her to a mysterious island where she met a wise old penguin named Gentoo. Gentoo told her about a legendary fashion designer named Hardy Amies, who once created costumes for a space odyssey. Intrigued, Moana decided to explore further.\n\nAs she traveled, she encountered a friendly dragon named Idris, who guided her through a maze of underground tunnels, much like the Circle Line in London. Along the way, they met a business of ferrets, who were busy organizing a grand festival.\n\nMoana learned that the festival was in honor of a heroic tale called 'The Last Castle,' where a brave doe named Bullseye saved her friends. Inspired by the story, Moana decided to join the festival, donning a pair of Skinny jeans she found along the way.\n\nThe festival was a vibrant celebration, with everyone singing songs from 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'

One day, she found an old, dusty book in her attic. As she opened it, she was transported back in time to June 1978, where she witnessed Ian Botham becoming the first cricketer to score a century and take eight wickets in one inning in a Test Match. \n\nHer journey continued as she met a friendly sow, a female skunk, who guided her to a magical theater.

Intrigued by the title, they decided to watch it, only to be inspired by the grand adventures and epic tales.\n\nEager to embark on their own adventure, the Minions set off to find the legendary boxer Jim Braddock, played by Russell Crowe in 'Cinderella Man.' They imagined themselves as his trainers, cheering him on in the ring.\n\nTheir journey took a wild turn when they encountered a hitch-hiker named John Ryder, played by Rutger Hauer. The Minions, always up for a challenge, decided to give him a ride, unaware of his notorious reputation.\n\nAs they traveled, they stopped at a quaint pub in northern England, where they tasted the famous Newcastle Brown Ale, originally launched by Col. James Porter in 1927. The Minions, with their love for all things quirky, found the ale delightful.\n\nTheir adventure continued into the galaxy far, far away, where they met Jabba the Hutt, the slug-like alien from Star Wars. The Minions, with their mischievous charm, managed to negotiate a deal with Jabba, promising to help him with his bounty on Han Solo.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the Minions found themselves in a rugby match, contesting the Cook Cup between England and Australia. Their antics on the field left everyone in stitches, proving that Minions could bring joy to any event.\n\nDuring a break, they decided to try surfing, learning about the 'skeg,' the fin underneath the rear of a surfboard. Their attempts at surfing were as chaotic as expected, but they had a blast nonetheless.\n\nAs the sun set, the Minions gathered around to watch 'Four Weddings and a Funeral,' written by Richard Curtis. They laughed and cried, enjoying the heartfelt moments of the film.\n\nFinally, they stumbled upon a garden filled with nardoo, a type of fern. The Minions, ever curious, decided to explore the garden, only to be interrupted by Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward from 'Thunderbirds,' who invited them for tea.\n\nAnd so, the Minions' day of adventure came to an end, filled with laughter, chaos, and unforgettable memories."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which British film, starring Ralph Fiennes, won nine Oscars in 1997?", "Who played boxer Jim Braddock in the 2005 film \u2018Cinderella man\u2019?", "Who plays murderous hitch-hiker John Ryder in the 1986 film \u2018The Hitcher\u2019?", "Which northern English beer was originally launched by Col.

The tribe gathered around the fire, listening intently as Sandi recounted her journey. Inspired by her courage, a young boy named Jack, who dreamed of becoming a butcher like his ancestor Lance-Corporal Jack Jones, vowed to explore the world beyond their icy home.\n\nIn the years that followed, the tribe thrived, guided by the wisdom of their elders and the adventurous spirit of their youth. And though the Ice Age eventually gave way to warmer times, the stories of Sandi, Lenin, and their tribe lived on, much like the designs of Thomas Chippendale, whose work would one day be celebrated in a book titled 'The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker\u2019s Director.'\n\nAnd so, in the land that was once Tylos, the legacy of the Ice Age endured, as timeless as the mascot Barney the Owl, who watched over the people of Sheffield Wednesday in a future yet to come."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 6, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt-4o", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp_wo_r_demo", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which country was formerly known by the Greeks as Tylos?", "Who played Margo Channing in the 1950 film \u2018All About Eve\u2019?", "Who is the host of the BBC television show QI?", "What is the name of the cockerel in the UK television series \u2018The Good Life\u2019?", "In humans, Gorham disease affects which part of the body?", "Which English Rugby Union team play their home games at Adams Park?", "In the UK television series \u2018Dad\u2019s Army\u2019, what was Lance-Corpopal Jack Jones occupation?", "What is the name of the fictional club in the James Bond novel \u2018Moonraker\u2019?", "Who published a 1754 book of his designs entitled \u2018The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker\u2019s Director\u2019?", "Barney the Owl is a mascot of which English football club?"], "answers": [["Asia/Bahrain", "\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "Bahrein", "Bahrayn", "Dawlat al-Bahrain", "Bahrein Islands", "Etymology of Bahrain", "Bahrain", "Bahrain islands", "Bahraih", "\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "Languages of Bahrain", "Emirate of Bahrain", "ISO 3166-1:BH", "Bahrain Islands", "Mamlakat al-Ba\u1e25rayn", "Bahrain's", "Bahrain/Geography", "Al-Ba\u1e25rayn", "Barhain", "Kingdom of Bahrain", "1923 Sitrah Outrage", "Al-Bahrayn", "iso 3166 1 bh", "bahrain", "barhain", "bahrayn", "languages of bahrain", "al ba\u1e25rayn", "emirate of bahrain", "mamlakat al ba\u1e25rayn", "bahrain geography", "dawlat al bahrain", "etymology of bahrain", "bahrein islands", "bahrain s", "\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "1923 sitrah outrage", "bahrain islands", "asia bahrain", "bahrein", "kingdom of bahrain", "al bahrayn", "\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "bahraih"], ["Ruth Davis", "Arthur Farnsworth.", "Harmon Nelson", "Davis, Bette", "Bette Davies", "Arthur Farnsworth (Bette Davis' husband)", "Ruth Elizabeth Davis", "Bette Davis", "Ruth Elizabeth %22Bette%22 Davis", "Bettie Davis", "ruth davis", "arthur farnsworth", "arthur farnsworth bette davis husband", "bettie davis", "davis bette", "ruth elizabeth 22bette 22 davis", "ruth elizabeth davis", "bette davies", "harmon nelson", "bette davis"], ["Stephen Fry", "Stephen fry", "Steven fry", "Steve Fry", "@stephenfry", "Steven Fry", "Rescuing the Spectacled Bear", "stephen fry", "stephenfry", "rescuing spectacled bear", "steven fry", "steve fry"], ["N.

One day, he received a mysterious letter inviting him to a grand adventure. The letter was sealed with a stamp depicting a cow, hinting at the origin of Limburger cheese.\n\nDr. Finlay's journey began in Canada, where he met a young leader named Joe Clark, who shared tales of his time as the youngest Prime Minister. As Dr. Finlay traveled, he encountered a footballer named Ryan Wilson, who was known for his incredible skills on the field.\n\nHis next stop was London, where he navigated the Underground, noting the black Northern Line that led him to his next clue.

While tidying up Earth, he stumbled upon an old deck of Uno cards. Intrigued by the terms Blaze, Bubble, and Shootout, he decided to learn more about this mysterious game.\n\nHis journey took him to a vibrant city called Leeds, where he heard the enchanting sounds of Opera North. As he wandered through the city, he noticed a bright yellow (or 'giallo' as the locals called it) poster of a rugby match featuring Jonny Wilkinson, proudly wearing his number 10 shirt.\n\nWall-E's adventure continued as he discovered a vintage record store playing tunes from Roxy Music, with Bryan Ferry's voice echoing through the air. Nearby, a television displayed an episode of 'Goodnight Sweetheart,' featuring the time-traveling antics of Gary Sparrow.\n\nAs night fell, Wall-E gazed up at the sky, mesmerized by the Beaver Moon of November. He recalled a slogan he had seen earlier, 'Probably the best lager in the world,' and wondered if Carlsberg was as refreshing as it claimed.\n\nHis journey concluded with a visit to a library, where he found an old book titled 'The Pilgrim's Progress.' Inside, he read about Mr. Worldly Wisemen and marveled at the wisdom of the past. He also stumbled upon a document about the Mahlabatari Declaration of Faith from Bangladesh, which inspired him to continue his quest for knowledge.\n\nWith a heart full of wonder and a mind buzzing with new information, Wall-E returned to his duties, eager to share his discoveries with his friends."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count":

She had heard tales of a distant land where a king named Henry III had reigned for 56 years, a time longer than any she could imagine.\n\nOne day, while exploring the woods, Pocahontas stumbled upon a peculiar sight\u2014a pink carriage, much like Lady Penelope\u2019s car from the stories of 'Thunderbirds.' Intrigued, she followed it to a bustling marketplace, reminiscent of the Carrefour stores she had heard about, where traders from all over gathered.\n\nIn the market, Pocahontas met a traveler who spoke of a grand race from London to Paris, with a prize of \u00a310,000. The traveler, who reminded her of the daring pilots in 'Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines,' shared tales of his adventures.\n\nAs Pocahontas continued her journey, she encountered a wise old man named Ken, who spoke of love and art, much like the director Ken Russell. He told her about a distant mountain, Mount Entoto, overlooking the city of Addis Ababa, a place of great beauty and mystery.\n\nIn her travels, Pocahontas also learned about the fascinating creatures of the world, like the skink, a type of lizard that scurried across her path. She imagined a future, perhaps in the year 1997, where people might explore the stars, much like the characters in 'Lost in Space.'\n\nOne day, Pocahontas received a special gift\u2014a shirt with the number 14, a symbol of peace and wisdom, much like the one given to the Dalai Lama by Bradford City FC.

Bok warned Mulan of a looming threat, a villainous force as puzzling as a Rubik\u2019s Cube with its 9 squares on each side.\n\nMulan, determined to protect her people, sought guidance from the wise Brockman family, known for their strategic brilliance. Along her journey, she marveled at the beauty of the louvar fish swimming in the clear waters, a symbol of peace and resilience.\n\nAs Mulan trained with her fellow warriors, she learned of Queen Joan of Navarre, the stepmother of Henry V, who had faced her own trials and tribulations. Inspired by the tales of the past, Mulan embraced her inner strength, much like the Grizzled Giant, Southern Flying, and Provost\u2019s squirrels that adapted to their environments.\n\nIn a decisive battle, Mulan's courage shone brightly, reminiscent of the Catherine wheel firework, illuminating the night sky. Her bravery was akin to the leadership of Andrew Bonar Law, who rose to prominence in challenging times.\n\nWith the wisdom of Emelius Browne, Mr. Jelk, and Colonel Heller from the enchanted world of 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks,' Mulan devised a plan that led to victory.

The brain regions will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is one example:\n--- \nExample Task: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid. \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Temporal Lobe; Limbic System; Occipital Lobe; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"We need to organize the poem into seven lines, with the first letters spelling 'CHATGPT.' The language should be simple enough for a ten-year-old, and we need to include basic explanations of quantum computing.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Let\u2019s recall the basics of quantum computing: it\u2019s a type of computer that uses qubits, allowing multiple states at once, unlike classical bits.

The first letters spell out 'CHATGPT,' and the poem stays focused on the topic.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Good job! The information about quantum computing is accurate, but I think we can simplify it a bit more for children.\"\nLimbic System: \"The tone feels light, but we could make it even more playful. Maybe add a bit more fun language.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! I\u2019ll simplify and adjust the tone.

The tone feels lighter and more playful.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"I agree. The explanation is even simpler now, and the playful language makes it more engaging for a child.\"\nHippocampus: \"I like how this reflects previous simple metaphors that work well for children. The playful nature helps.\"\nLimbic System: \"I love the playful tone!

Inspired by the dazzling lights and the thrill of adventure, Bolt decided to embark on a journey to uncover the secrets of the past.\n\nHis first stop was a local theater, where he watched a performance by six talented male strippers, reminiscent of the famous act from 'The Full Monty.' As the show ended, Bolt overheard a conversation about a legendary crown, St. Edward's Crown, used in British coronations.\n\nIntrigued, Bolt set off to Scotland, the land where Dolly the Sheep was famously cloned. There, he met an old historian who shared tales of notorious highwaymen like John Rann and Claude Duval, who once roamed the roads.\n\nWith each story, Bolt felt a connection to the past, much like Fred Astaire's reflections in 'Steps in Time.' He realized that life was a dance, and he was just learning the steps.\n\nAs Bolt continued his journey, he remembered the words of Groucho Marx, 'A man is only as old as the woman he feels,' and smiled, thinking of his youthful spirit.\n\nIn his travels, Bolt encountered a peacock, its feathers shimmering in the sunlight.

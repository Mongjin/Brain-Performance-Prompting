Growing up, she would often sing \u201cIf I Were a Rich Man\u201d from **Fiddler on the Roof**, imagining herself leading a life of grandeur on grand stages around the world. Her fascination with stories led her to devour classics like **Mutiny on the Bounty**, enthralled by its sequels, **Men Against the Sea** and **Pitcairn's Island**.\n\nInspired by the enigmatic Truman **Persons**, whose real name was Capote before adoption, Elsa decided to pen her own mysteries. One evening, while reading Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark,\" she pondered how the elusive snark transformed into a **Boojum** to outwit its hunters\u2014a metaphor she found perfect for her new novel.\n\nElsa's spiritual side was equally strong. She often reflected on the Biblical tale of **Joshua**, before whom the sun and moon stood still, finding solace and strength in such timeless stories. Her creative pursuits didn't go unnoticed; her screenplay for a film titled **Dangerous Minds** gained unexpected popularity, especially after it received a boost from Coolio\u2019s hit song \"Gangsta's Paradise,\" much like the **Michelle Pfeiffer** movie that had thrived with the song's support.\n\nHer middle name, **Rudolph**, was a constant reminder of resilience, echoing the strength of President Gerald **Rudolph** Ford. Despite her artistic inclinations, Elsa had briefly considered becoming an **architect**, inspired by Art **Garfunkel**, who had trained in the field before choosing a different path.\n\nA trip to Berlin introduced her to the poignant history of **Rudolf Hess**, the last inmate of Spandau Jail, whose story added depth to Elsa's understanding of human complexity.

Growing up, she would often sing \u201cIf I Were a Rich Man\u201d from **Fiddler on the Roof**, imagining herself leading a life of grandeur on grand stages around the world. Her fascination with stories led her to devour classics like **Mutiny on the Bounty**, enthralled by its sequels, **Men Against the Sea** and **Pitcairn's Island**.\n\nInspired by the enigmatic Truman **Persons**, whose real name was Capote before adoption, Elsa decided to pen her own mysteries. One evening, while reading Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark,\" she pondered how the elusive snark transformed into a **Boojum** to outwit its hunters\u2014a metaphor she found perfect for her new novel.\n\nElsa's spiritual side was equally strong. She often reflected on the Biblical tale of **Joshua**, before whom the sun and moon stood still, finding solace and strength in such timeless stories. Her creative pursuits didn't go unnoticed; her screenplay for a film titled **Dangerous Minds** gained unexpected popularity, especially after it received a boost from Coolio\u2019s hit song \"Gangsta's Paradise,\" much like the **Michelle Pfeiffer** movie that had thrived with the song's support.\n\nHer middle name, **Rudolph**, was a constant reminder of resilience, echoing the strength of President Gerald **Rudolph** Ford. Despite her artistic inclinations, Elsa had briefly considered becoming an **architect**, inspired by Art **Garfunkel**, who had trained in the field before choosing a different path.\n\nA trip to Berlin introduced her to the poignant history of **Rudolf Hess**, the last inmate of Spandau Jail, whose story added depth to Elsa's understanding of human complexity. This visit ignited a new subplot for her novel, intertwining historical intrigue with personal growth.\n\nElsa's passion for storytelling reached its pinnacle when she cast her first lead, reminiscent of **Eddie Murphy's** breakthrough in \"48 Hrs.\" The film was a success, marking the beginning of Elsa\u2019s illustrious career.

While exploring the attic, Buzz Lightyear discovered an old, weathered map dated **1925**, hinting at hidden treasures scattered throughout their world.\n\n\"Looks like we've got a mission, team!\" Buzz announced, adjusting his wings. \"To find these treasures, we'll need to visit places inspired by history.\"\n\nTheir first stop was the **Wisconsin Gate**, named after Truax Field International Airport. There, they met Ezer, a wise old toy modeled after **Ezer Weizman**, Israel\u2019s head of state since **1993**. Ezer shared that the treasures were guarded by Heinrich, a stern toy representing **Heinrich Himmler**, the WWII-era Nazi security chief.\n\nUndeterred, Woody, Buzz, Jessie, and Chuck\u2014a supersonic jet toy inspired by **Chuck Yeager**, the first American to break the sound barrier\u2014set off toward **Texas Ridge**, the Gulf state nearest the end of the alphabet. As they journeyed through the Belle Fourche and Grand Rivers-themed play areas, they encountered numerous challenges.\n\nAt the old toy stadium, reminiscent of the **1904 Olympics** where Americans won **16** track and field titles, the team had to solve puzzles to advance. Each puzzle piece reflected their triumphs and teamwork, much like the athletes\u2019 victories.\n\nTheir adventure peaked when they reached the hidden chamber guarded by Heinrich. Using their combined strengths and recalling the first in-flight movie shown in **1925**, they devised a clever plan to distract Heinrich. With Chuck\u2019s supersonic speed, they outmaneuvered the guard, securing the treasures.\n\nAs they celebrated their success, Richard\u2014a presidential toy based on **Richard Nixon**, the first US president interviewed by Barbara Walters\u2014hosted a grand celebration. He recounted tales of bravery, much like Jack Ruby\u2019s infamous moment in **1963** when he acted decisively in a pivotal moment of history.\n\nWith the treasures safely returned to Andy, the toys reflected on their journey. They had navigated through historical landmarks, faced formidable challenges, and emerged victorious, strengthening their bond as they looked forward to future adventures together.\n\n**The End**"],

Tony Stark quickly deciphered that the message pointed to a series of orchestrated events aimed at plunging the city into chaos.\n\nTheir investigation led them to an elaborate advertisement campaign featuring Eva Herzigova with the slogan \"Hello Boys.\" This campaign was promoting a limited edition product inspired by Heinz's famous \"57 varieties,\" hinting at the number 57 mentioned in the distress signal. Natasha Romanoff surmised that the villain was drawing on nostalgic elements to distract and confuse the Avengers.\n\nAs they delved deeper, Captain America recalled that as of March 2001, Ian Wright held the record for the most league goals for Arsenal. This soccer legend was now key to the villain's plan, using his legacy to rally crowds and divert attention. Meanwhile, Thor discovered historical data indicating that John F. Kennedy was the American President when the Berlin Wall was constructed, suggesting the villain was using historical timelines to manipulate events.\n\nThe Avengers traced the chaos to a secret underground lair accessible via the Piccadilly line\u2014the only London Underground line connecting with every other line. Inside, they encountered intricate traps resembling a standard set of 28 dominoes, meticulously arranged to hinder their progress. Black Widow noticed that the traps were synchronized with dart targets, requiring a minimum of nine darts to disable them, reminiscent of the minimum throws needed to complete a leg from 501 in darts.\n\nIn the lair\u2019s command center, they found remnants of Benjy and Laska\u2014monkeys sent into space in 1958\u2014as part of a failed experiment to harness extraterrestrial technology. The villain had repurposed this technology to amplify his disruptive schemes. Hawkeye, utilizing his precision, launched nine darts to deactivate the mainframe, while Hulk dismantled physical barriers with ease.\n\nAmidst the confrontation, holograms of the first British football team to win the European Cup, Celtic, appeared, symbolizing the unity and strategic prowess needed to overcome the villain.

Tony Stark quickly deciphered that the message pointed to a series of orchestrated events aimed at plunging the city into chaos.\n\nTheir investigation led them to an elaborate advertisement campaign featuring Eva Herzigova with the slogan \"Hello Boys.\" This campaign was promoting a limited edition product inspired by Heinz's famous \"57 varieties,\" hinting at the number 57 mentioned in the distress signal. Natasha Romanoff surmised that the villain was drawing on nostalgic elements to distract and confuse the Avengers.\n\nAs they delved deeper, Captain America recalled that as of March 2001, Ian Wright held the record for the most league goals for Arsenal. This soccer legend was now key to the villain's plan, using his legacy to rally crowds and divert attention. Meanwhile, Thor discovered historical data indicating that John F. Kennedy was the American President when the Berlin Wall was constructed, suggesting the villain was using historical timelines to manipulate events.\n\nThe Avengers traced the chaos to a secret underground lair accessible via the Piccadilly line\u2014the only London Underground line connecting with every other line. Inside, they encountered intricate traps resembling a standard set of 28 dominoes, meticulously arranged to hinder their progress. Black Widow noticed that the traps were synchronized with dart targets, requiring a minimum of nine darts to disable them, reminiscent of the minimum throws needed to complete a leg from 501 in darts.\n\nIn the lair\u2019s command center, they found remnants of Benjy and Laska\u2014monkeys sent into space in 1958\u2014as part of a failed experiment to harness extraterrestrial technology. The villain had repurposed this technology to amplify his disruptive schemes. Hawkeye, utilizing his precision, launched nine darts to deactivate the mainframe, while Hulk dismantled physical barriers with ease.\n\nAmidst the confrontation, holograms of the first British football team to win the European Cup, Celtic, appeared, symbolizing the unity and strategic prowess needed to overcome the villain. Tony Stark realized that the final piece of the puzzle was linked to the number 28 from the domino set, representing the interconnectedness of their mission.\n\nAs the Avengers subdued the antagonist, they reflected on the intricate web of clues\u2014from Heinz varieties and Ian Wright\u2019s legacy to historical presidents and space-bound monkeys.

Katniss Everdeen, a cunning tribute from District 12, found herself reflecting on stories from the old world as she prepared for the ultimate showdown.\n\nOne evening, under the dim lights of the training center\u2014a place reminiscent of the old ITV show \"Magpie\" which had once entertained children with bright presenters like Jenny Hanley and Tommy Boyd\u2014Katniss received an unexpected letter. It was penned by a boy named Jonah, much like in the 1993 film \"Sleepless in Seattle.\" In his heartfelt message, Jonah asked Annie to meet his father at the Empire State Building on St. Valentine\u2019s Day, a tradition from a time when love was celebrated openly, not suppressed by Capitol's decree.\n\nAs Valentine's Day approached, Katniss couldn\u2019t shake the melody of Billy Idol's \"Valentine,\" a top ten hit from 1988 that once symbolized rebellion and passion. The song played in her mind like a rallying cry, reminding her of the courage needed to survive. The second most common word in written English, \"of,\" seemed trivial, yet it held the essence of connection\u2014something Katniss desperately sought in the isolated arena.\n\nThe arena itself was a labyrinth inspired by the classic arcade game Pac-Man, where ghosts named Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde roamed relentlessly. Each ghost represented a different district\u2019s nightmare, turning the Games into a battleground of strategy and survival. Katniss navigated these dangers with the precision of a hunter, her every move shadowed by the eerie presence of these spectral foes.\n\nIn the shadows of the arena, remnants of the old world\u2019s sci-fi visions lingered. Drawing inspiration from the cult film \"Blade Runner,\" which starred Harrison Ford and was based on Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,\" the Capitol had introduced androids disguised as tributes, blurring the lines between human and machine. These replicants were nearly indistinguishable, forcing tributes to question every alliance and every threat.\n\nBack in the Capitol\u2019s media hub, reminiscent of the bygone \"Magpie\" era, announcers like Neil Morrissey provided commentary with a robotic charm, their voices guiding the public's perception of the Games. The voice of Bob The Builder, immortalized in the number one hit \"Can We Fix It,\" echoed through the broadcasts, a stark contrast to the chaos unfolding in the arena.\n\nAmong the tributes, a fox-like competitor named Finn stood out. Agile and sly, Finn embodied the cunning of Robin Hood from the Disney cartoon, evading traps and outsmarting opponents with ease.

Katniss Everdeen, a cunning tribute from District 12, found herself reflecting on stories from the old world as she prepared for the ultimate showdown.\n\nOne evening, under the dim lights of the training center\u2014a place reminiscent of the old ITV show \"Magpie\" which had once entertained children with bright presenters like Jenny Hanley and Tommy Boyd\u2014Katniss received an unexpected letter. It was penned by a boy named Jonah, much like in the 1993 film \"Sleepless in Seattle.\" In his heartfelt message, Jonah asked Annie to meet his father at the Empire State Building on St. Valentine\u2019s Day, a tradition from a time when love was celebrated openly, not suppressed by Capitol's decree.\n\nAs Valentine's Day approached, Katniss couldn\u2019t shake the melody of Billy Idol's \"Valentine,\" a top ten hit from 1988 that once symbolized rebellion and passion. The song played in her mind like a rallying cry, reminding her of the courage needed to survive. The second most common word in written English, \"of,\" seemed trivial, yet it held the essence of connection\u2014something Katniss desperately sought in the isolated arena.\n\nThe arena itself was a labyrinth inspired by the classic arcade game Pac-Man, where ghosts named Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde roamed relentlessly. Each ghost represented a different district\u2019s nightmare, turning the Games into a battleground of strategy and survival. Katniss navigated these dangers with the precision of a hunter, her every move shadowed by the eerie presence of these spectral foes.\n\nIn the shadows of the arena, remnants of the old world\u2019s sci-fi visions lingered. Drawing inspiration from the cult film \"Blade Runner,\" which starred Harrison Ford and was based on Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,\" the Capitol had introduced androids disguised as tributes, blurring the lines between human and machine. These replicants were nearly indistinguishable, forcing tributes to question every alliance and every threat.\n\nBack in the Capitol\u2019s media hub, reminiscent of the bygone \"Magpie\" era, announcers like Neil Morrissey provided commentary with a robotic charm, their voices guiding the public's perception of the Games. The voice of Bob The Builder, immortalized in the number one hit \"Can We Fix It,\" echoed through the broadcasts, a stark contrast to the chaos unfolding in the arena.\n\nAmong the tributes, a fox-like competitor named Finn stood out. Agile and sly, Finn embodied the cunning of Robin Hood from the Disney cartoon, evading traps and outsmarting opponents with ease. His presence was both admired and feared, a symbol of natural prowess amidst synthetic horrors.\n\nAs the Games progressed, Katniss uncovered a hidden alliance paying homage to Marlon Brando, who had famously received four million dollars for his brief but impactful role in \"Superman.\" This tribute, representing immense power in a fleeting moment, became a pivotal player in the arena\u2019s dynamics.\n\nIn the final moments of the Games, when the score reached 111\u2014a term known in cricket as \"Nelson,\" traditionally considered unlucky\u2014the true battle began.

His keen instincts and unwavering bravery provided the fellowship with invaluable insights into the dangers that lay ahead. \"Together, we can overcome any challenge,\" he affirmed, strengthening their unity.\n\nAs the night deepened, Michelle McManus, a celebrated bard and Pop Idol of Middle-earth, took to the stage. Her haunting rendition of \"All This Time\" captivated the audience, weaving magic into every note and lifting their spirits for the trials to come.\n\nTheir evening was illuminated by stories of triumph and sacrifice, much like the first time \"White Christmas\" was sung in the classic film \"Holiday Inn.\" These tales fortified their resolve, reminding them of the enduring power of hope and friendship.\n\nWith hearts full and spirits renewed, the fellowship prepared to continue their quest. Each member, inspired by legends both old and new\u2014from the perfect scores of gymnastic greats to the resilience of champions like Fred Perry\u2014knew that their journey was more than a mere adventure. It was a tapestry of courage, unity, and the indomitable will to protect the lands they held dear.\n\nAnd so, under the watchful eyes of Gandalf and the stars above, they set forth once more, ready to etch their own episode into the grand saga of Middle-earth."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "o1-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "o1-mini", "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 59999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What word is given to a point in tennis which has to be replayed?", "How many episodes of Prisoner: Cell Block H were made?", "Who is the last English-born player to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon?", "In 1976, which gymnast scored 7 maximum scores of 10 as she won three gold medals, one silver and one bronze?", "In years and days, how old was Luigina Giavotti when she won a silver medal in gymnastics in 1928, and is still the youngest medal winner today?", "Which Eastenders actor has played the policeman Nick Rowan on TV?", "What type of animal was Boris, the subject of a song by The Who?", "Which brand of beer does Homer Simpson drink regularly?", "In which film was the song White Christmas first sung?", "Which Pop Idol had a number one hit in 2004 called All This Time?"], "answers": [["Let (disambiguation)", "Let", "LET", "LET (disambiguation)", "let disambiguation", "let"], ["692", "six hundred and ninety-two", "692", "six hundred and ninety two"], ["Fred Perry", "Fred J.

The Grinder taught Gene the importance of focus and practice, helping him refine his abilities. Together, they traveled to the Cricket Grounds of Code, where they encountered Michael Holding, the fast bowler emoji nicknamed \"Whispering Death.\" Michael's swift moves and strategic thinking showed Gene how to navigate challenges with grace and speed.\n\nTheir adventures led them to Eastemojis, a charming neighborhood within Textropolis, where they met an endearing character named Pete with his loyal dog, Willy. Willy's unwavering loyalty and playful spirit reminded Gene of the importance of friendship and trust. Reflecting on these lessons, the trio reminisced about the year 1979, the setting of the first episode of \"Minder,\" a classic show that symbolized enduring bonds and teamwork.\n\nContinuing their quest, they encountered Squimsy, the mischievous cat emoji from \"Rising Damp.\" Squimsy's clever antics and humorous nature brought laughter to their journey, lightening the mood during tough times. Together, they shared stories reminiscent of Johnny Speight's \"Till Death Us Do Part,\" featuring a fervent West Ham supporter emoji, whose passion and resilience inspired them to persevere.\n\nAs they delved deeper into Textropolis, Gene and his friends stumbled upon \"Steptoe and Son,\" a duo of emojis who showcased heartfelt camaraderie over 57 episodes. Their unwavering support for each other highlighted the value of partnership and understanding, further strengthening Gene's resolve.\n\nTheir path eventually led them to the Canadian Gardens, a tribute to Bonar Law, the only British Prime Minister born outside the UK. The serene environment of the gardens provided a moment of reflection, reminding Gene that greatness can arise from diverse origins.\n\nFinally, their journey brought them to the magical Hundred Acre Wood, home to Winnie the Pooh and his friends. In this enchanting place, surrounded by Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, and Eeyore, Gene discovered that his uniqueness was his greatest strength. Embracing his diverse expressions, Gene realized that he could connect different parts of Textropolis, fostering unity and creativity.\n\nWith newfound confidence, Gene returned to Textropolis, where he became a beloved figure, bridging gaps and inspiring others to celebrate their individuality. The city flourished with diversity, much like the Hundred Acre Wood, and Gene's adventures became legendary, reminding everyone that being true to oneself leads to the most extraordinary journeys.\n\nAnd so, in the heart of the Emoji Movie universe, Gene's quest for identity brought together elements of history, sports, classic television, and timeless stories, weaving a tale of self-acceptance and unity that resonated with emojis and users alike.\n\n**The End**"], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 6, "question_count": 10}], "model": "o1-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "o1-mini", "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 59999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following success at the 1979 election whose party conference speeech included the lines 'you turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning'?", "Which snooker player was simply known as 'The Grinder'?", "Which former West Indian fast bowler was known as 'Whispering Death'?", "Which Eastenders character had a dog called Willy?", "In which year did the first episode of Minder take place?", "What was the name of the cat in Rising Damp?", "Which comedy written by Johnny Speight which first aired in 1965, featured a fervent West Ham supporter?", "What was the name of the comedy written by Ray Galton, Alan Simpson which aired 57 episodes?", "Bonar Law is the only Prime Minister not born in the UK.

Inspired by the **United States' impressive tally of 37 medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics**, Daniel was determined to achieve greatness.\n\nOne evening, Mr. Miyagi shared a humorous story about the fourteenth **Carry On** film, \"Follow That Camel,\" where iconic British comedian Sid James was replaced by a charismatic **American actor**. This blend of British tradition and American flair resonated with Daniel, highlighting the beauty of cultural exchange.\n\nDuring their training sessions, Mr. Miyagi often displayed Pablo Picasso's artwork, particularly \"**The Weeping Woman**,\" to teach Daniel about emotional expression and resilience. They discussed the **Koppen System**, a climate classification method, drawing parallels between adapting to different climates and adapting karate techniques to various challenges.\n\nOne sunny day, Mr. Miyagi recounted the tale of **Tiresias** from Greek mythology, who disclosed **Oedipus**' hidden crimes. This story emphasized the importance of honesty and facing one's truths, lessons that Daniel took to heart both on and off the dojo mat.\n\nTo teach practical skills, Mr. Miyagi introduced Daniel to fishing, demonstrating the use of a **gaff**\u2014an iron hook attached to a pole used to land heavy fish. As they worked together by the lakeside, Mr. Miyagi played tunes reminiscent of **Cat Stevens**, the English singer-songwriter who penned the Tremeloes hit \"Here Comes My Baby\" at eighteen. This music inspired Daniel's perseverance and creativity.\n\nDaniel often thought of his family back in the US, particularly recalling the adventures of TV characters who had a child named **Mearth**.

Inspired by the **United States' impressive tally of 37 medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics**, Daniel was determined to achieve greatness.\n\nOne evening, Mr. Miyagi shared a humorous story about the fourteenth **Carry On** film, \"Follow That Camel,\" where iconic British comedian Sid James was replaced by a charismatic **American actor**. This blend of British tradition and American flair resonated with Daniel, highlighting the beauty of cultural exchange.\n\nDuring their training sessions, Mr. Miyagi often displayed Pablo Picasso's artwork, particularly \"**The Weeping Woman**,\" to teach Daniel about emotional expression and resilience. They discussed the **Koppen System**, a climate classification method, drawing parallels between adapting to different climates and adapting karate techniques to various challenges.\n\nOne sunny day, Mr. Miyagi recounted the tale of **Tiresias** from Greek mythology, who disclosed **Oedipus**' hidden crimes. This story emphasized the importance of honesty and facing one's truths, lessons that Daniel took to heart both on and off the dojo mat.\n\nTo teach practical skills, Mr. Miyagi introduced Daniel to fishing, demonstrating the use of a **gaff**\u2014an iron hook attached to a pole used to land heavy fish. As they worked together by the lakeside, Mr. Miyagi played tunes reminiscent of **Cat Stevens**, the English singer-songwriter who penned the Tremeloes hit \"Here Comes My Baby\" at eighteen. This music inspired Daniel's perseverance and creativity.\n\nDaniel often thought of his family back in the US, particularly recalling the adventures of TV characters who had a child named **Mearth**. These stories underscored the support and love that fueled his journey, reminding him of what he was striving to protect.\n\nAs the time came for the national karate tournament in **Minnesota**\u2014a state humorously rumored to frown upon mispronunciations of its name\u2014Daniel felt a mix of nerves and excitement.

Torres Dam, the largest hydro plant in Mexico, which had recently been replicated as a tourist attraction in Brooklyn. Donatello was tinkering with a new gadget inspired by the intricate structure of the dam, while Mikey recited lines from \"A Kid for Two Farthings\" by Wolf Mankowitz, laughing at the clever wordplay.\n\nSuddenly, their peaceful day was interrupted by a distress signal encoded in the NATO phonetic alphabet. \"I need assistance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,\" the message began with the word \"India.\" The Turtles knew they had to act quickly. Leonardo, ever the leader, reminded them of their training\u2014just as the meibomian glands in the eyelids produce essential oils, their teamwork was crucial for maintaining balance.\n\nAt the museum, they discovered that a valuable comic from the first issue of the British children's comic published in April 1950 had been stolen. Raphael speculated it might be linked to their arch-nemesis, Shredder. As they searched for clues, Donatello explained how the scapula bone connects the humerus to the clavicle, a fact that oddly mirrored the connections between their allies and the artifacts they protected.\n\nMeanwhile, a hologram of Sir Robert Walpole, Britain\u2019s first Prime Minister, appeared, revealing that the thief was inspired by historical figures and literary greats. The Turtles realized they needed to outsmart someone well-versed in both history and literature. Michelangelo, recalling Rebecca Adlington\u2019s Olympic gold medals in the 400 and 800 meters freestyle from 2008, suggested they use speed and agility to navigate the museum\u2019s security.\n\nAs they cornered the thief in the grand hall, the villain confessed to being a fan of Norman Mailer, author of \"The Naked and the Dead,\" and Frank McCourt, the Brooklyn-born author with parents named Malachy and Angela.

Torres Dam, the largest hydro plant in Mexico, which had recently been replicated as a tourist attraction in Brooklyn. Donatello was tinkering with a new gadget inspired by the intricate structure of the dam, while Mikey recited lines from \"A Kid for Two Farthings\" by Wolf Mankowitz, laughing at the clever wordplay.\n\nSuddenly, their peaceful day was interrupted by a distress signal encoded in the NATO phonetic alphabet. \"I need assistance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,\" the message began with the word \"India.\" The Turtles knew they had to act quickly. Leonardo, ever the leader, reminded them of their training\u2014just as the meibomian glands in the eyelids produce essential oils, their teamwork was crucial for maintaining balance.\n\nAt the museum, they discovered that a valuable comic from the first issue of the British children's comic published in April 1950 had been stolen. Raphael speculated it might be linked to their arch-nemesis, Shredder. As they searched for clues, Donatello explained how the scapula bone connects the humerus to the clavicle, a fact that oddly mirrored the connections between their allies and the artifacts they protected.\n\nMeanwhile, a hologram of Sir Robert Walpole, Britain\u2019s first Prime Minister, appeared, revealing that the thief was inspired by historical figures and literary greats. The Turtles realized they needed to outsmart someone well-versed in both history and literature. Michelangelo, recalling Rebecca Adlington\u2019s Olympic gold medals in the 400 and 800 meters freestyle from 2008, suggested they use speed and agility to navigate the museum\u2019s security.\n\nAs they cornered the thief in the grand hall, the villain confessed to being a fan of Norman Mailer, author of \"The Naked and the Dead,\" and Frank McCourt, the Brooklyn-born author with parents named Malachy and Angela. The stolen comic was meant to complete his collection, symbolizing the fusion of his favorite stories and heroes.\n\nWith a combination of strategy and swift moves, the Turtles apprehended the thief and retrieved the prized comic. Leonardo thanked his brothers, emphasizing the importance of their unique strengths\u2014much like the diverse elements they had encountered that day.

Drawing inspiration from Getafix, the wise village druid from the Asterix comics, Yugi focused his mind to overcome the visual illusions.\n\nThe duel unfolded under the watchful eye of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s birthplace, Lincolnshire, echoing the determination of the British athletes Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams from \"Chariots of Fire.\" As tensions rose, Yugi remembered the classic tactics seen in John Huston's 1941 film \"The Maltese Falcon,\" using cunning and precision to outmaneuver his opponent.\n\nIn a climactic move, Yugi summoned a card adorned with two green stars, symbolizing clarity and vision. This decisive play shattered the curse, freeing the spirits and restoring peace to Lincolnshire. The friends celebrated their victory, grateful for the lessons learned from history, mythology, and their enduring bond through the game of Yu-Gi-Oh!"], "parsing_success_flag": [true],

Inspired by **Jack Higgins**, the author of thrilling tales like \"The Eagle Has Landed,\" they felt empowered to face whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\nFinally, reaching the peak of Zugspitze, they discovered Poopdeck Pappy's relic guarded by a formidable Bakugan. A fierce battle ensued, blending the graceful dances taught by Jack and Dave with strategic maneuvers inspired by ancient games.

It's said to grant unparalleled power to any Bakugan who wields it.\"\n\nIntrigued, Jack examined the map closely. \"Interesting,\" he mused. \"The path leads us through the ancient **peg board** forests, where games like Round the Clock and Hare and Hounds were once played by legendary warriors. We'll need to navigate these tricky terrains carefully.\"\n\nAs the trio embarked on their quest, they encountered challenges that tested their skills. In the heart of the peg board forest, they stumbled upon an old tavern where tales of **Mary**, the last Catholic monarch of England, were still whispered. Lily recalled lines from **Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\"**, where Tewkesbury Mustard was mentioned, symbolizing the enduring legacy of past leaders and their influence on present adventures.\n\nTheir journey took them to the bustling Bakugan arena, where the number **13** held special significance. Legend had it that only on the 13th day of the lunar cycle could trainers unlock hidden powers within their Bakugan. With the square root of 169 being 13, this number was a beacon guiding them toward their goal.\n\nAs night fell, they set up camp under the stars, reflecting on the legacy of leaders like **Lyndon B. Johnson**, who became JFK's Vice President in 1961, embodying resilience and strategic thinking\u2014qualities essential for their mission. Inspired by **Jack Higgins**, the author of thrilling tales like \"The Eagle Has Landed,\" they felt empowered to face whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\nFinally, reaching the peak of Zugspitze, they discovered Poopdeck Pappy's relic guarded by a formidable Bakugan. A fierce battle ensued, blending the graceful dances taught by Jack and Dave with strategic maneuvers inspired by ancient games. Harnessing the power of friendship, legacy, and the lessons learned along the way, Lily triumphed, securing the relic and ensuring peace across the Bakugan realms.\n\nAs they descended the mountain, the Harmony Dojo celebrated their victory, knowing that the blend of dance, strategy, and history had once again safeguarded their world. The tale of their adventure became a new chapter in Bakugan lore, inspiring future trainers to seek harmony and strength in every battle."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 10}], "model": "o1-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "o1-mini", "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 59999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What are the first names of the two dancing instructors in the UK television series \u2018Hi De Hi\u2019?", "Poopdeck Pappy is which fictional character\u2019s father?", "On a standard dartboard, which number lies between 4 and 6?", "Who was the last Catholic monarch to reign over England?", "Round the Clock, Hare and Hounds, Cricket and Shanghai are all games played on which type of board?", "Tewkesbury Mustard is mentioned in which Shakespeare play?", "What is the square root of 169?", "Who became US President John Kennedy\u2019s Vice President in 1961?", "Who wrote the novel \u2018The Eagle Has landed\u2019?", "The Zugsptize is the highest mountain in which European country?"], "answers": [["Barry and Yvonne", "barry and yvonne"], ["Popeye Cigarettes", "Popeye the Sailor Man", "Popeye the Sailorman", "Popeye (2016 film)", "Popeye (2015 film)", "The Thimble Theatre", "Popeye The Sailor", "Popeye (upcoming film)", "Popeye (2014 film)", "Thimble Theater", "Thimble Theatre", "Popeye the Sailor", "Popeye the sailor man", "Pop Eye", "The Popeye and Olive Oyl Show", "Jack Mercer (sailor)", "Popeye", "popeye and olive oyl show", "thimble theatre", "popeye 2014 film", "popeye", "pop eye", "thimble theater", "popeye sailorman", "popeye sailor", "jack mercer sailor", "popeye sailor man", "popeye cigarettes", "popeye upcoming film", "popeye 2015 film", "popeye 2016 film"], ["13", "thirteen", "13", "thirteen"], ["James II of Ireland", "James II (England)", "King James VII", "James II of England", "James Duke Of York", "James II of england", "King James II", "James VII", "James VII of Scots", "James Stuart, Duke of York", "James II Stuart", "King James II of England", "James II, King of England", "James VII/II", "James Ii", "James VII of the UK", "James II (of England)", "James VII of Scotland and II of England", "King James VII of Scotland", "James of York", "James the Second", "James VII of the United Kingdom", "James ii", "James II and VII", "Jimmy Two", "James II & VII", "James VII of Scotland", "James II", "Cultural depictions of James II of England", "James II of England, VII of Scotland", "James VI of Scotland and II of England", "James the Shit", "James II of Great Britain", "James II of England and VII of Scotland", "James VII and II", "James, Duke of York", "KJII", "james second", "james vii of uk", "james ii king of england", "jimmy two", "king james ii", "james ii stuart", "james ii of england and vii of scotland", "james vii and ii", "kjii", "james vii", "james ii of england vii of scotland", "james vii of scotland", "king james vii", "king james vii of scotland", "james ii and vii", "james ii", "james ii of ireland", "james of york", "james vii of scots", "cultural depictions of james ii of england", "james ii of england", "james vi of scotland and ii of england", "james ii of great britain", "james stuart duke of york", "james ii england", "king james ii of england", "james vii ii", "james vii of scotland and ii of england", "james ii vii", "james shit", "james vii of united kingdom", "james duke of york"], ["Jumpers (Darts)", "Electronic dartboard", "Electronic Dartboard", "Dartboard", "Flight (darts)", "Dart game", "Round the Clock (Darts)", "Darts (sport)", "Darts", "Dart board", "Round the clock (darts)", "dartboard", "flight darts", "dart board", "electronic dartboard", "jumpers darts", "dart game", "darts", "round clock darts", "darts sport"], ["King Henry IV", "Henry IV (play)", "Henry 4", "Hendrik IV", "Heinrich IV", "Henry the Fourth", "Henry IV (disambiguation)", "Henry Iv", "Henry IV", "Henry iv", "hendrik iv", "heinrich iv", "henry iv play", "henry iv disambiguation", "henry 4", "king henry iv", "henry iv", "henry fourth"], ["13", "thirteen", "13", "thirteen"], ["Rebekah Baines", "President Lyndon B Johnson", "President Lyndon Baines Johnson", "Presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson", "All I have I would have given gladly...", "President Lyndon B.

Just then, a holographic figure resembling Jack Nicholson appeared, offering guidance reminiscent of his strong presence in films like \u201cIronweed\u201d and \u201cThe Pledge.\u201d His advice helped them face their fears, much like Benjamin Franklin\u2019s famous kite experiment had uncovered the electrical nature of lightning, empowering Fear to confront Riley\u2019s anxieties.\n\nAs they journeyed further, they reached December Island\u2014the third month alphabetically\u2014which was adorned with festive decorations that lifted Riley\u2019s spirits during colder times. However, lurking in the shadows were the Erinys, the fierce Furies from Greek mythology, embodying Riley\u2019s pent-up anger and the need for emotional release. To maintain trust and openness, the emotions adhered to the Chatham House Rule, ensuring that Riley\u2019s secrets remained safe within her mind.\n\nIn a vibrant district inspired by fashion, they met a statue of Christian Dior, creator of the iconic \u2018New Look\u2019 from 1947, symbolizing Riley\u2019s desire for self-expression and change. Their path then led them to a studio reminiscent of Andy Warhol\u2019s, where they encountered a hologram of Valerie Solanas, a reminder of past pains and the importance of healing wounds.\n\nThrough these diverse experiences, the emotions learned to balance Riley\u2019s inner turmoil. They realized that understanding historical events like Krakatoa\u2019s eruption, embracing playful aspects from \"CatDog,\" and drawing strength from figures like Machiavelli and Franklin were essential in guiding Riley through her emotions. By honoring the Chatham House Rule and appreciating influences from Dior and Warhol, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust worked together harmoniously, ensuring Riley\u2019s emotional well-being and helping her navigate the complexities of growing up."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "o1-mini", "output_dir": "",

This year, she sought to infuse the celebration with a blend of tradition and global inspiration. To achieve this, she had commissioned the esteemed British fashion designer Anthony Powell, renowned for his visionary work on Stanley Kubrick\u2019s **2001: A Space Odyssey**, to create stunning costumes that would dazzle the islanders.\n\nAs she wandered through the bustling stalls, memories of classic tales fluttered through her mind. She recalled the loyalty of **Bull's-eye**, the faithful dog from Charles Dickens' **Oliver Twist**, symbolizing unwavering dedication\u2014a trait she admired deeply. To symbolize unity, Moana planned a central stage inspired by London's **Circle line**, the only Underground line connecting every other line, ensuring that every segment of the festival seamlessly intertwined.\n\nMoana's vision extended to storytelling performances, where tales of strength and resilience would be portrayed. She envisioned a character akin to Colonel Winter from **The Last Castle**, played by James Gandolfini, embodying both authority and complexity. To add a touch of nature\u2019s charm, she decided to include a female gerbil, a **jill**, showcasing the island's diverse wildlife.\n\nIn collaboration with local artists, Moana introduced a mythical dragon named **Dragon**, reminiscent of the friendly fire-breathing creature from the children\u2019s series **Ivor the Engine**. This dragon would dance alongside a **business** of ferrets, their playful antics symbolizing community and cooperation. To celebrate the diverse avian life, representations of **penguins**\u2014Gentoo, Adelie, and Macaroni\u2014would grace the festivities, highlighting the beauty of different species coming together.\n\nFashion played a pivotal role in the festivities. Models clad in various styles of **jeans**\u2014Straight Cut, Boot Cut, and Skinny\u2014walked the runway, blending modern trends with traditional island motifs. The finale was a spectacular rendition of the stage musical **Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat**, a production that had seen stars like Phillip Schofield, Jason Donovan, and Donny Osmond grace its stages worldwide. The performance promised to captivate the audience with its vibrant colors and compelling narrative.\n\nAs the festival night arrived, the island shimmered under the starlit sky. Anthony Powell\u2019s costumes sparkled, the stories of Bull's-eye and Colonel Winter intertwined with the playful dragons and ferrets, and the harmonious blend of jeans styles reflected Motunui\u2019s evolving culture.

To achieve this, she had commissioned the esteemed British fashion designer Anthony Powell, renowned for his visionary work on Stanley Kubrick\u2019s **2001: A Space Odyssey**, to create stunning costumes that would dazzle the islanders.\n\nAs she wandered through the bustling stalls, memories of classic tales fluttered through her mind. She recalled the loyalty of **Bull's-eye**, the faithful dog from Charles Dickens' **Oliver Twist**, symbolizing unwavering dedication\u2014a trait she admired deeply. To symbolize unity, Moana planned a central stage inspired by London's **Circle line**, the only Underground line connecting every other line, ensuring that every segment of the festival seamlessly intertwined.\n\nMoana's vision extended to storytelling performances, where tales of strength and resilience would be portrayed. She envisioned a character akin to Colonel Winter from **The Last Castle**, played by James Gandolfini, embodying both authority and complexity. To add a touch of nature\u2019s charm, she decided to include a female gerbil, a **jill**, showcasing the island's diverse wildlife.\n\nIn collaboration with local artists, Moana introduced a mythical dragon named **Dragon**, reminiscent of the friendly fire-breathing creature from the children\u2019s series **Ivor the Engine**. This dragon would dance alongside a **business** of ferrets, their playful antics symbolizing community and cooperation. To celebrate the diverse avian life, representations of **penguins**\u2014Gentoo, Adelie, and Macaroni\u2014would grace the festivities, highlighting the beauty of different species coming together.\n\nFashion played a pivotal role in the festivities. Models clad in various styles of **jeans**\u2014Straight Cut, Boot Cut, and Skinny\u2014walked the runway, blending modern trends with traditional island motifs. The finale was a spectacular rendition of the stage musical **Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat**, a production that had seen stars like Phillip Schofield, Jason Donovan, and Donny Osmond grace its stages worldwide. The performance promised to captivate the audience with its vibrant colors and compelling narrative.\n\nAs the festival night arrived, the island shimmered under the starlit sky. Anthony Powell\u2019s costumes sparkled, the stories of Bull's-eye and Colonel Winter intertwined with the playful dragons and ferrets, and the harmonious blend of jeans styles reflected Motunui\u2019s evolving culture. The musical brought everyone together, a testament to Moana\u2019s vision of unity and celebration. Surrounded by her community, Moana felt a profound sense of accomplishment, knowing that this festival would be remembered as a harmonious blend of tradition, storytelling, and global influences."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 10}], "model": "o1-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "o1-mini", "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 59999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which British fashion designer was commissioned by Stanley Kubrick to design the costumes for the film \u20182001: A Space Odyssey\u2019?", "In the Charles Dickens novel \u2018Oliver Twist\u2019 what is the name of Bill Sykes dog?", "Which line on the London Undergound rail system is the only line which interconnects with every other line?", "James Gandolfini plays the sadistic military prison commandant Colonel Winter in which 2001 film starring Robert Redford?", "What is a female gerbil called?", "In the children\u2019s television series \u2018Ivor the Engine\u2019 what is the name of the dragon?", "What is a group of ferrets called?", "Gentoo, Adelie and Macaroni are all species of which bird?", "In fashion Straight Cut, Boot Cut and Skinny are all types of what?", "Phillip Schofield, Jason Donovan and Donny Osmond have all played the starring role in which stage musical?"], "answers": [["Hardy Amies", "Sir Hardy Amies", "Edwin Hardy Amies", "hardy amies", "sir hardy amies", "edwin hardy amies"], ["Bulls eye", "Bulls Eye", "Bullseye (disambiguation)", "Bullseyes", "Bullseye", "Bullseye (game show)", "bulls eye", "bullseye disambiguation", "bullseyes", "bullseye", "bullseye game show"], ["Jubilee line", "Fleet Line", "Jubilee Line", "Fleet line", "jubilee line", "fleet line"], ["The Last Castle", "Last Castle", "last castle"], ["DOE", "Doe (disambiguation)", "Doe", "DoE", "doe disambiguation", "doe"], ["Idris", "Idris (disambiguation)", "\u0130dris", "idris", "idris disambiguation", "i\u0307dris"], ["The business", "The Business (disambiguation)", "A business", "The Business", "business", "business disambiguation"], ["Penquins", "Ptilopteri", "Sphenisciformes", "Penguine", "\ud83d\udc27", "Sphenisiformes", "Spheniscinae", "Pengiuns", "Behavior patterns of adult penguins", "Penguines", "Spheniscid\u00e6", "Spheniscidae", "Penguins", "Speniscidiformes", "A penguin", "Penquin", "Penguin eggs", "Impennes", "Isabelline penguin", "Penguin", "\ud83d\udc27", "penguin eggs", "behavior patterns of adult penguins", "spheniscidae", "penguins", "isabelline penguin", "spheniscinae", "penguines", "sphenisciformes", "penguin", "penguine", "spheniscid\u00e6", "penquins", "penquin", "sphenisiformes", "ptilopteri", "pengiuns", "impennes", "speniscidiformes"], ["Riveted jeans", "Blue-jeans", "Jeans trousers", "Jeans pant", "Blue Jeans", "Straight jeans", "Blue jeans", "Jeans", "Straight leg jeans", "Blue jean insulation", "\ud83d\udc56", "Jean cuts", "Destroyed jeans", "Bluejeans", "blue jean insulation", "riveted jeans", "straight leg jeans", "\ud83d\udc56", "jean cuts", "bluejeans", "blue jeans", "jeans trousers", "jeans pant", "straight jeans", "jeans", "destroyed jeans"], ["Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph's Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph And The Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat", "Joseph & the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat", "Joseph and the Amazing Techicolor Dreamcoat", "Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat", "Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "Joseph and the amazing technicolour dreamcoat", "Jatd", "jatd", "joseph and technicolor dreamcoat", "joseph and amazing technicolour dreamcoat", "dreamcoat", "amazing technicolor dreamcoat", "technicolor dreamcoat", "joseph s amazing technicolor dreamcoat", "joseph and amazing techicolor dreamcoat", "joseph and amazing technicolor dreamcoat", "joseph amazing technicolor dreamcoat"]], "question_ids": ["qb_4229", "qb_4235", "qb_4284", "qb_4289", "qb_4301", "qb_4306", "qb_4325", "qb_4336", "qb_4368", "qb_4427"], "topic": "Moana"}}

Unlike their human counterparts who raced through the bogs of **Wales**, the ants had crafted miniature snorkels and prepared tirelessly for the competition. Flik, an inventive ant inspired by the tales of **A.J. Cronin**, dreamed of building the most advanced snorkel ever.\n\nOne day, Flik discovered an old Scrabble board, abandoned near the hive. Counting the **seventeen double-word score squares**, he realized he could use the tiles to decode messages from beyond their world. His curiosity led him to learn about **Olympus Mons**, the largest known volcano on **Mars**, sparking ideas for their snorkelling strategies by mimicking the towering structures.\n\nAs the championships approached, the ants faced sabotage from the grasshoppers, led by Hopper, who had cunning plans inspired by hidden agents, much like those in \"**From Russia with Love**,\" the second James Bond film. To counter them, Flik sought the help of the legendary builder, **Joseph Cyril Bamford**, founder of the ant-equivalent of JCB, to reinforce their equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, the wise old horse, **Black Beauty**\u2014a revered elder in the colony named after Anna Sewell's noble steed\u2014advised Flik to stay true to their strengths.

Unlike their human counterparts who raced through the bogs of **Wales**, the ants had crafted miniature snorkels and prepared tirelessly for the competition. Flik, an inventive ant inspired by the tales of **A.J. Cronin**, dreamed of building the most advanced snorkel ever.\n\nOne day, Flik discovered an old Scrabble board, abandoned near the hive. Counting the **seventeen double-word score squares**, he realized he could use the tiles to decode messages from beyond their world. His curiosity led him to learn about **Olympus Mons**, the largest known volcano on **Mars**, sparking ideas for their snorkelling strategies by mimicking the towering structures.\n\nAs the championships approached, the ants faced sabotage from the grasshoppers, led by Hopper, who had cunning plans inspired by hidden agents, much like those in \"**From Russia with Love**,\" the second James Bond film. To counter them, Flik sought the help of the legendary builder, **Joseph Cyril Bamford**, founder of the ant-equivalent of JCB, to reinforce their equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, the wise old horse, **Black Beauty**\u2014a revered elder in the colony named after Anna Sewell's noble steed\u2014advised Flik to stay true to their strengths. The colony's strength lay in their unity, much like the **Green** family\u2014Al Green the singer, Hughie Green the host, and Philip Green the businessman\u2014each contributing their unique talents under the shared surname.\n\nOn the day of the competition, the ants traveled through their version of the London Underground, passing the fictitious **Walford East** station, which had replaced the old Bank station on their tiny tube map, designed by **Malcolm Bradbury**, the celebrated author whose stories intertwined with their lives.\n\nWith Flik's innovative snorkels and the colony's unwavering spirit, they navigated the bogs of Wales, overcoming obstacles inspired by the harsh landscapes of Mars.

Intrigued, Harry scanned a nearby parchment revealing that the renowned musical 'Sunset Boulevard' had enchanted audiences since its US premiere on December 10, 1993.\n\nSuddenly, a portrait swung open, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman stepped out, offering cryptic advice about leadership and resilience. Harry pondered the connection when he found an old diary mentioning Kathleen Ferrier. The diary hinted at a magical ailment, akin to breast cancer, that once claimed her life.

Instantly, it sprang to life, resonating with Exile's iconic 70s hit 'Kiss You All Over,' its notes weaving through the air with a touch of magic.\n\nBeside the jukebox lay a dusty scroll revealing that the famed musical 'Sunset Boulevard' had a magical debut in the United States on December 10, 1993, captivating both Muggle and wizard audiences alike with its spellbinding performances. As Harry absorbed this, a portrait flickered and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the British Prime Minister who succeeded Arthur Balfour, appeared with a wise smile. He imparted lessons on leadership, courage, and the importance of preserving magical heritage.\n\nHarry's eyes then fell upon an old, weathered diary detailing the life of Kathleen Ferrier, a celebrated witch singer whose vibrant spirit was dimmed by a mysterious ailment resembling breast cancer. The diary spoke of her battles and the magical community's efforts to find a cure, inspiring Harry deeply.

Walker shared tales of courage, encouraging Bilbo to persevere.\n\nFurther along, Bilbo discovered a magnificent gown designed by the renowned Catherine Walker. This dress, now enchanted, held the power to unite allies and amass resources, proving invaluable for Bilbo's mission.\n\nFinally, deep within the ancient caves, Bilbo uncovered a scroll co-founded by Yasser Arafat in 1957, detailing strategies to bring peace and harmony to Middle-earth.\n\nWith all five treasures in hand, Bilbo returned to the Shire, his heart filled with pride and joy.

They embarked on an adventure to find the legendary Hidden Grove, a place rumored to hold magical secrets about nature.*\n\n*As they wandered, they discovered a cozy drey nest high in an oak tree, home to a friendly squirrel named Sammy. Sammy explained that his family was struggling to gather enough acorns for the winter. Determined to help, the gang teamed up with Sammy.*\n\n*Further along, they stumbled upon a beaver's lodge by the sparkling stream. Benny the Beaver welcomed them and showed how he constructs his lodge to store food and keep his family safe during the winter. Benny offered to help build stronger storage areas, teaching the children the importance of preparation.*\n\n*While walking through the area adorned with lush aquatic plants, they learned about the different types of vegetation that thrive in water-logged conditions. Lucy pointed out how these plants provide shelter for various wildlife, inspiring the group to create natural barriers to protect Sammy's acorns.*\n\n*As the day turned to evening, Charlie Brown felt his heart racing from the day's efforts. Recalling his lesson about the sinoatrial node, the heart's pacemaker, he understood the importance of keeping a steady rhythm to stay energized. This knowledge gave him the perseverance to keep pushing forward.*\n\n*Working together, the friends enhanced Sammy's drey and Benny's lodge, ensuring that both families would survive the winter. The adventure taught everyone the importance of teamwork, nature, and the incredible ways animals adapt to their environments.

We'll tackle this together. After all, the letter 'T' is the second most common letter we use every day, just like teamwork is our second nature.\"\n\nThe game involved solving puzzles related to various facts. The first question was about the inventor who became famous in 1867. Elroy quickly answered, \"Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite!\" earning the family their first points.\n\nThe next challenge was tricky: \"Which letter does not appear in any of the names of the 50 American states?\" George scratched his head, but Rosie the robot assistant chimed in, \"It's the letter 'Q'!\"\n\nJudy, despite her fear, faced the final round where they had to name a debut single by a famous girl group. Elroy exclaimed, \"It's 'Wannabe' by the Spice Girls!\"\n\nWith all answers correct, the Jetsons won the game show. Judy felt a surge of confidence overcoming her taphephobia, thanks to her supportive family.

Together with Maria, they forged alliances with Fantasia's denizens to restore harmony.\n\nBastian realized that his own story within the book was intertwined with these heroes and villains. To rewrite the fate of Fantasia, he had to believe in the power of imagination and unity. With courage in his heart, he confronted the Horsemen, drawing strength from the legends of St. George and the leadership of Dick Cheney.\n\nIn the end, love and bravery triumphed over chaos, and Fantasia thrived once more, proving that even in a never-ending story, hope and friendship are timeless.\n\n---\n\n**Frontal Lobe:** \"This draft successfully integrates all the required answers into the **NeverEnding Story** framework.

Determined to reunite their divorced parents, they embarked on an adventurous plan. While rummaging through their father's old belongings, they found a vintage vinyl of The Beatles' 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.' On the cover, amidst the colorful characters, Billy Preston stood out, holding his iconic trumpet.*\n\n*Curious, they played the album and were captivated by 'Taxman.' The song's opening line, \"The taxman's taken all my dough,\" sparked a conversation about their father's struggles and secrets. Their quest led them to London, where they visited The Blind Beggar pub\u2014the very place where history had taken a dark turn with the Kray twins' infamous act in 1966. Inside the pub, they uncovered a hidden letter that revealed their parents had met there under mysterious circumstances.*\n\n*As they pieced together the past, the haunting melodies of Henry Mancini's Pink Panther theme echoed through their journey, adding an air of mystery and excitement. Their efforts brought laughter and tears, reminiscent of the heartwarming romance of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, who had married on Valentine\u2019s Day in 1991. In the end, Emily and Emma's perseverance paid off, reuniting their parents and restoring the family's harmony, all sparked by the echoes of music and history woven into their adventure.*\n\n---"], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "o1-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "o1-mini", "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 59999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who holds a trumpet on the album cover of Sgt.

Her famous saying, \"You turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning,\" echoed through the city halls, inspiring citizens to stand firm in their convictions.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Thalia announced the first-ever Zootopia Snooker Championship, hoping to bring the community together. Among the participants was Sheldon Shellby, a meticulous tortoise dubbed 'The Grinder' for his patient and relentless playstyle. Sheldon was a local legend, respected for his dedication to the game.\n\nAs the tournament progressed, Sheldon faced fierce competition from Leo \"Whispering Death\" Jaguar, a swift and silent bowler from the outskirts of the city. Leo's speed and precision made him a formidable opponent, much like his namesake from the cricket fields of old.\n\nMeanwhile, in the nostalgic neighborhood of 1979 Grove, Ricky Fox and his loyal dog, Willy, cheered from the sidelines. Ricky, a savvy entrepreneur, had ties to the city's history, having started his vintage car restoration business back when Minder first aired on local TV in 1979. Willy, always by his side, provided unwavering support and companionship.\n\nThe final match between Sheldon and Leo was intense. The entire city watched as they showcased their skills, embodying the spirit of competition and camaraderie. In the end, Sheldon's perseverance paid off as he clinched the championship, earning the respect of all, including the quiet Leo.\n\nMayor Thalia celebrated the victory with a grand parade, where Ricky and Willy were honored for their contributions to the community. The event marked a new chapter for Zootopia, blending tradition with progress, and reminding everyone that with determination and teamwork, any challenge could be overcome.\n\n---\n\nThis story weaves together the key elements from the five questions into the vibrant world of Zootopia, creating a narrative that's both engaging and meaningful."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 1, "question_count": 5}], "model": "o1-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "o1-mini", "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 59999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following success at the 1979 election whose party conference speeech included the lines 'you turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning'?", "Which snooker player was simply known as 'The Grinder'?", "Which former West Indian fast bowler was known as 'Whispering Death'?", "Which Eastenders character had a dog called Willy?", "In which year did the first episode of Minder take place?"], "answers": [["Baroness Margaret Thatcher", "Lady Thatcher", "Margret thatcher", "The Baroness Thatcher", "Margret Thatcher", "The Lady Thatcher", "Margaret Tatcher", "Margaret Thatcher", "Mrs T", "Mrs Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher", "Mrs. T", "Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven", "Margaret Thatcer", "Margaret Thatcher's", "Mrs Finchley", "Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher", "Thatcherian", "Margaret Thacher", "Margaret Thatcher bibliography", "Margaret Thatcher Day", "M thatcher", "Lady T", "Maggie Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Thatcher", "Milk snatcher", "Baroness The Margaret Thatcher", "Margaret Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Roberts Thatcher", "Margeret Thatcher", "Margareth Thatcher", "Mrs Denis Thatcher", "Margaret Hilda Roberts", "Mrs. Thatcher", "Milk Snatcher", "Margaret Thatcher Library", "Margaret thatcher", "Baroness Thatcher", "Margeret thatcher", "margaret hilda thatcher", "margaret hilda thatcher baroness thatcher", "baroness thatcher", "margaret thatcher", "margaret thatcher s", "margaret tatcher", "prime minister margaret thatcher", "margaret thatcher day", "maggie thatcher", "mrs thatcher", "m thatcher", "thatcherian", "lady thatcher", "mrs finchley", "baroness margaret thatcher", "margaret thatcher library", "margareth thatcher", "margret thatcher", "mrs t", "baroness thatcher of kesteven", "milk snatcher", "margaret hilda roberts", "margaret thatcer", "margaret thacher", "margeret thatcher", "margaret thatcher baroness thatcher", "margaret hilda roberts thatcher", "mrs denis thatcher", "margaret thatcher bibliography", "lady t"], ["Cliff Thorburn", "Rhett Butler of the green baize", "Champagne Cliff", "cliff thorburn", "champagne cliff", "rhett butler of green baize"], ["Michael Holding", "Mike Holding", "michael holding", "mike holding"], ["Ethel Skinner", "ethel skinner"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine", "1979", "1979", "one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine"]], "question_ids": ["qz_3736", "qz_3745", "qz_3752", "qz_3760", "qz_3775"], "topic": "Zootopia"}}

There, amidst the olive groves and ancient ruins, she listened to the harmonious strings of a mandolin, reminiscent of *Captain Corelli's Mandolin*, filling the air with enchanting melodies.\n\nHer journey didn't end there. Guided by the stars, Pocahontas found herself in the quaint village of **Evergreen**, where the heartwarming chatter at **The Bull** pub echoed stories of everyday country folk. Inside, she met kind-hearted villagers who shared their lives and dreams, reminding her of home.\n\nAs she sipped on a warm beverage, a mysterious storyteller began recounting tales of **Anne Boleyn**, the second wife of Henry VIII. Pocahontas was fascinated by the parallels of their strength and resilience, drawing inspiration from Anne's legacy.\n\nHer adventure continued when she encountered a charming interviewer, portrayed by **Christian Slater**, who sought to understand her unique journey. Their conversation delved deep into cultures, histories, and the bridges that connect different worlds.\n\nFinally, Pocahontas's path led her to the vibrant streets of **Key West, Florida**, the southernmost city in the USA. Here, she reflected on her incredible voyage, cherishing the diverse experiences and friendships forged along the way.\n\nWith a heart full of memories, Pocahontas returned home, forever enriched by her journey beyond the horizons she once knew.\n\n---\n\n**Limbic System:** \"This story beautifully intertwines all the required elements while maintaining emotional resonance.

One sunny morning, Bolt found himself at the foot of the majestic **Mallard**, the legendary steam locomotive that had carved its name into history by racing at an unprecedented 126 mph back in July 1938 on England's East Coast Mainline.\n\nFueled by tales of speed and bravery, Bolt decided to board the Mallard for a journey through time and space. As the engine roared to life, Bolt's paws tapped the rhythm, reminding him of the vibrant nights at **Madison Square Garden**, which Bono once called 'Rock and roll's great cathedral.' The echoes of music and cheers filled Bolt's ears, adding to the excitement of his adventure.\n\nMid-journey, the Mallard glided past ancient temples where the legendary monk **Bodhidharma**, known as 'The Blue-Eyed Barbarian,' meditated under the serene skies. Bolt paused to admire Bodhidharma's calm presence, feeling a sense of peace amidst the rush of time.\n\nSuddenly, the train stopped abruptly. Bolt sensed something was amiss and remembered the harrowing tale from **1970**, the year of the only hijacking of a British commercial flight. Determined to help, Bolt navigated through the tense atmosphere, using his quick reflexes to ensure everyone's safety.\n\nAs the journey continued, Bolt gazed out the window at the vast ocean, recalling the grandeur of the **Lusitania**, the famed Cunard ocean liner launched on September 20, 1906. The sight of the mighty ship sailing smoothly reassured Bolt, filling him with hope and determination.\n\nBy the time the Mallard reached its destination, Bolt had woven together threads of history, music, and courage. He realized that every moment, whether fast like the Mallard or calm like Bodhidharma, contributed to the rich tapestry of his adventures.\n\n---"], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "o1-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "o1-mini", "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 59999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What is the name of the steam locomotive which set the world speed record in July 1938 by reaching 126 mph on the East Coast Mainline  in England?", "Singer and musician Bono called which venue \u2018Rock and roll\u2019s great cathedral\u2019?", "Which 5th/6th Century Buddhist monk is described in Chinese texts as \u2018The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\u2019?", "Which year saw the only hijacking of a British commercial flight?", "What was the name of the Cunard ocean liner which was launched on 20th September 1906?"], "answers": [["Mallard Duck", "Mallards", "Platyrhynchos", "Mallard duck", "Anas platyrhynchos", "Anas boschas", "Mallard", "Wild Duck", "Stock Duck", "Wild Ducks", "Mallard ducks", "anas platyrhynchos", "mallard ducks", "anas boschas", "mallards", "wild duck", "stock duck", "mallard", "mallard duck", "platyrhynchos", "wild ducks"], ["Madison square garden", "Madison Square Garden IV", "The MSG", "M.S.G.", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Square Gardens", "Theatre at Madison Square", "Gilmores Garden", "Madison Square Garden 4", "Madison Square Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals Series of 1994", "MSG IV", "The M.S.G.", "Madison Square Garden (1968)", "Knicks-Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Madison Square Garden Training Center", "knicks rangers finals series of 1994", "m s g", "knicks\u2013rangers championship runs of 1994", "knicks\u2013rangers finals series of 1994", "madison garden", "msg iv", "madison square garden 1968", "madison square garden iv", "madison square garden training center", "madison square garden", "madison square gardens", "theatre at madison square", "knicks rangers championship runs of 1994", "gilmores garden", "msg", "madison square garden 4"], ["Da mo", "Bodhi-Dharma", "Tamo", "Bodidarma", "Bodhiharma", "Da Mo's cave", "Bodhidarma", "Bodhi Dharma", "Bodhidharma at Shaolin", "Bloodstream Sermon", "Bodhidharma", "bodidarma", "da mo s cave", "bodhidarma", "bloodstream sermon", "bodhi dharma", "tamo", "da mo", "bodhiharma", "bodhidharma", "bodhidharma at shaolin"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and seventy", "1970", "1970", "one thousand nine hundred and seventy"], ["Domain of Moor", "Mauretania Secunda", "Roman Mauretania", "Mauretanian Kingdom", "Ancient mauretania", "Kingdom of Mauretania", "Roman-Moorish kingdoms", "Roman-Moor Kingdoms", "Mauretania Prima", "List of Kings of Mauretania", "King of Mauretania", "Classical mauretania", "Mauretania Sitifensis", "Classical morocco", "Mauretania", "List of kings of Mauretania", "Sitifensis", "mauretania prima", "domain of moor", "classical morocco", "sitifensis", "king of mauretania", "mauretanian kingdom", "list of kings of mauretania", "roman moorish kingdoms", "roman moor kingdoms", "ancient mauretania", "classical mauretania", "mauretania sitifensis", "mauretania secunda", "kingdom of mauretania", "roman mauretania", "mauretania"]], "question_ids": ["qb_404", "qb_406", "qb_470", "qb_483", "qb_495"], "topic": "Bolt"}}

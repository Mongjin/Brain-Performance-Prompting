They were engrossed in a match, each point filled with excitement and anticipation. Suddenly, a disputed point arose, and the word 'let' echoed through the air, signaling a replay.\n\nAs the Iron Giant observed the game, memories of his own past flooded his circuits. He recalled the countless episodes of challenges he had faced, much like the characters in the Prisoner: Cell Block H series. Each episode a test of his resilience and determination.\n\nIn a moment of reflection, the Iron Giant remembered the last English-born player to triumph at Wimbledon, a feat that echoed the spirit of victory and perseverance.

Jack had a passion for martial arts and trained diligently every day at the local dojo. His determination and focus were unmatched, much like the star of the 2005 film Racing Stripes, a zebra named Stripes who dreamt of becoming a racehorse. One day, as Jack was practicing his katas, he stumbled upon an old book in the dojo library. The book was written by the famous author Dick Francis, known for his thrilling novels based around horse racing. Jack found inspiration in the stories of courage and determination, much like his own journey in mastering karate. As Jack delved deeper into his training, he came across a newspaper article in the dojo lounge. The article featured the beloved Scottish newspaper that showcased the adventures of the Broons and Oor Wullie. Jack was intrigued by the tales of friendship and camaraderie, much like the bonds he formed with his fellow karate students. With each passing day, Jack's skills in karate improved, thanks to the unwavering support of his friends. They stood by him through thick and thin, just like the characters in the Scottish newspaper. Together, they faced challenges and celebrated victories, forging bonds that would last a lifetime. As the holiday season approached, the dojo prepared for a special karate tournament. The festive spirit filled the air, and the students practiced diligently to the tune of classic Christmas songs. One particular song, with the line 'It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle,' brought back memories of simpler times for Jack and his friends. As the tournament day arrived, Jack and his friends were filled with nervous excitement. The dojo was abuzz with anticipation, much like the energy of a stadium cheering for their favorite footballer.

Determined to uncover the truth, Po embarked on a quest that would test his strength and determination.\n\nAs Po journeyed through the bamboo forests, he encountered a group of warriors who were responsible for the production of the Spitfire, a powerful weapon that could turn the tide of any battle. Intrigued by their craftsmanship, Po sought to learn their ways and master the art of combat.\n\nDuring his training, Po stumbled upon a mysterious scroll that contained the lyric 'Always sunny in a rich man's world.' The words resonated with him, hinting at a deeper meaning that would shape his destiny.\n\nAs Po honed his skills and faced formidable foes, he learned of the legendary men's singles title at Wimbledon in 1987, a symbol of excellence and victory. Inspired by the champions of the past, Po pushed himself to new heights, determined to become a true master of Kung Fu.\n\nIn the final showdown, Po faced off against a formidable opponent who wielded Victor Krum's wand, a powerful artifact that could bend reality to its will. With the fate of China hanging in the balance, Po unleashed his inner strength and embraced the teachings of his mentors, emerging victorious in a battle that would go down in history."],

With his first wish, Aladdin asked to be transported to the enchanting world of Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan, as told in Shakespeare's play 'The Tempest.' In this mystical realm, Aladdin encountered wonders beyond his wildest imagination.\n\nIn the midst of his adventures, Aladdin found himself soaring through the skies on the wings of a Panavia Tornado, the RAF fighter-bomber built by the Panavia partnership. The exhilarating flight led him to a hidden oasis where he met Rodney, a lovable plonka, who shared tales of his dreams of becoming a millionaire, echoing the catchphrases from the iconic television sitcom 'Only Fools and Horses.'\n\nAmidst the laughter and camaraderie, Aladdin's true love surprised him with a gift on the Sixth Day of Christmas - six geese a-laying, symbolizing abundance and new beginnings. As he marveled at the thoughtful gesture, Aladdin's thoughts drifted to the 2012 London Olympics, where Louis Smith won an individual silver medal in gymnastics for his exceptional performance in the discipline of pommel horse.\n\nFilled with gratitude and a sense of wonder, Aladdin realized that the greatest treasures were not found in gold or jewels, but in the bonds of friendship, love, and the magic of the world around him."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt35-turbo", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp1", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 3999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which Shakespeare play tells the story of Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan?", "Which RAF fighter-bomber was built by the Panavia partnership?", "\"Rodney you plonka\" and \"This time next year we'll be millionaires\" are catchphrases from which well-known television sitcom?", "What did my true love bring to me on the Sixth Day of Christmas?", "Louis Smith won an individual silver medal in gymnastics at the 2012 London Olympics.

As she journeyed through the lush forests and majestic mountains, she encountered a wise old artist who designed the logo for Chupa Chups lollipops. The artist shared his wisdom with Mulan, inspiring her to embrace her creativity and inner strength. Next, Mulan arrived at the Olympic Park, where the world's longest and tallest structure was being built. The grandeur of the construction filled her with awe, reminding her of the importance of perseverance and determination in the face of challenges. Along her path, she discovered the first Beatles film, which inspired her with its message of unity and harmony. Guided by Bagheera, Mulan faced various challenges with courage and resilience. As Mulan's journey neared its end, she reached the bustling streets of Liverpool, where the Beatles regularly played at a nightclub named The Cavern Club. The vibrant energy of the music-filled nights filled Mulan with a sense of community and belonging, reminding her of the power of friendship and unity. Mulan's journey had transformed her into a warrior not just in battle but in spirit.

Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The brain regions will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary. \n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1 \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Parietal Lobe; Basal Ganglia; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"To solve this, we need to create a clear plan that systematically tests different combinations.

I\u2019ll focus on how the numbers relate logically. For instance, combining 12 and 12 could give 24, but we need to find a way to use all the numbers. What about considering pairs of numbers and their divisors?\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"Let me automate part of this process. Based on past patterns, using multiplication and addition has frequently been successful in similar problems.

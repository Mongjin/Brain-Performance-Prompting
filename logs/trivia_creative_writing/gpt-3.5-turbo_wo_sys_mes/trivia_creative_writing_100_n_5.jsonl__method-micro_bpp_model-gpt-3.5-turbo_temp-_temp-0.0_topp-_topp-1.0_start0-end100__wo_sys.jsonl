As he wandered through the snowy streets, he stumbled upon an old radio playing a familiar tune by the singer who had a big 60s No 1 with Roses Are Red. The melody stirred memories long forgotten, softening his heart ever so slightly. Curiosity piqued, the Grinch approached an unusual vehicle with plates bearing the international registration letters of Iceland, sparking a sense of wanderlust within him. As he gazed up at the starlit sky, reminiscing about the Live Aid concert held in America, a sense of awe washed over him.

He had a special bond with his pet zebra, which reminded him of the star of the 2005 film Racing Stripes. Jack's love for karate was inspired by the novels of author Dick Francis, who wrote thrilling stories based around horse racing. His determination to excel in the sport mirrored the protagonists in Francis' novels. One day, Jack stumbled upon an old newspaper featuring the Broons and Oor Wullie, which sparked his curiosity about his Scottish heritage. Little did he know that this discovery would lead him to a mysterious adventure. As Jack delved deeper into his family history, he came across an ancient Christmas song that mentioned 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle.' This cryptic clue hinted at a hidden treasure that could change his life forever.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Medial Prefrontal Cortex; Left Inferior Parietal Lobule; Left Inferior Temporal Gyrus; Occipital Lobe; Basal Ganglia; Right Temporoparietal Junction; Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n\nLeft Inferior Parietal Lobule: \"We need to use the numbers 6, 12, 1, and 1 to make 24 by applying basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

We might need to start with smaller numbers to gradually build up to 24.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it!

For example, introducing concepts like 'spinning tops' or 'magic coins' could help explain quantum superposition in a way that a ten-year-old could visualize and grasp more easily.\"\nLeft Inferior Parietal Lobule: \"Instead of 'entwined in dual state,' we could say 'two states they embrace,' which is easier to understand while retaining the core quantum idea. Also, replacing 'haze' with 'puzzling maze' gives a clearer image.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"Visually, the words 'puzzling maze' create a clearer, more tangible image than 'haze,' which can be vague.

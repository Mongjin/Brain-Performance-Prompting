Excited, Mario set off on his journey, imagining the adventures that awaited him.\n\nAs Mario traveled through the lush landscapes, he stumbled upon a film set where the stunning Ava Gardner was filming. She was voted Miss Greenwich Village in 1942, and she shared a secret with Mario about the treasure's location, giving him a hint to look for a book.\n\nMario followed Ava's advice and found an old library. There, he discovered Michael Jackson's autobiography, 'Moonwalk,' which contained a riddle that pointed him to the final clue.\n\nWith the riddle solved, Mario ventured to a hidden cave where he found a collection of vintage stereo records from the 1950s.

He thought about how, as Alexander Pope once said, \"To err is human but it feels divine.\" He had made many mistakes in his life, especially when it came to stealing Christmas.\n\nOne day, while he was sulking, he heard a cheerful tune wafting through the air. It was Bobby Vinton singing \"Roses Are Red,\" and it made him pause. The Grinch couldn\u2019t help but tap his foot to the catchy melody.\n\nAs he looked out at the Whos celebrating below, he noticed a car with the international registration letters \"IS\" parked nearby. It belonged to a visitor from Iceland who had come to join the festivities. The Grinch felt a twinge of curiosity about the world beyond his mountain.\n\nSuddenly, he remembered the Live Aid concert that had taken place in Philadelphia. He had watched it on TV, and it had inspired him to think about how he could help others instead of just being grumpy.\n\nFinally, as he reflected on his life, he thought about the longest moon landing, Apollo 17, and how it was a reminder that even the most distant dreams could be reached. The Grinch realized that perhaps he could change his ways and join the Whos in their celebration.\n\nWith a newfound sense of joy, the Grinch decided to join the Whos. He dressed up in a Santa suit and brought gifts to share. As he entered the town, he felt a warmth in his heart that he had never experienced before. The Grinch realized that it was never too late to change, and that the true spirit of Christmas was about giving and love."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["\"Who said, To err is human but it feels divine?\"\"\"", "Which singer had a big 60s No 1 with Roses Are Red?", "What are the international registration letters of a vehicle from Iceland?", "Where was the American venue of the Live Aid concert?", "Which was the longest moon landing?"], "answers": [["Mae West", "Mae west", "Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me%3F", "When I'm Bad, I'm Better", "Jane Mast", "When I'm good, I'm very good...", "Mae West filmography", "mae west filmography", "is that gun in your pocket or are you just happy to see me 3f", "mae west", "when i m bad i m better", "when i m good i m very good", "jane mast"], ["Bobby Vinton", "bobby vinton"], ["I S", "I.s.", "IS", "I.S.", "Is.", "IS (disambiguation)", "Is", "is", "i s", "is disambiguation"], ["Philedelphia", "City of brotherly love", "City of Brotherly Love", "The Quaker City", "Philadelphia", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.", "Philadelphia, Pa.", "List of nicknames for Philadelphia", "Philidalphia", "Philadelphia, United States", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.", "Philadelphia PA", "Philadelphia Suburban Rail", "Philadelphi", "Philadelphia, U.S.", "Philadelphia Regional Rail", "The City of Brotherly Love", "City of Philadelphia", "Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)", "Wiccacoa", "Philadelpia, Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia, USA", "Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania", "Government of Philadelphia", "Philadelphia (PA)", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA", "Philadelphia (City)", "UN/LOCODE:USPHL", "The City That Loves You Back", "Philadelphia (Pa.)", "Phila.", "The Cradle of Liberty", "The city of brotherly love", "Philadelphia (city, Pennsylvania)", "Philidelphia", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US", "Philadelphia Commuter Rail", "The City and County of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Philadephia, Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia City", "Philadelphia Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia City Controller", "Philladelphia", "Political families of Philadelphia", "Philadelphia, Pa", "Philadelphia, PA", "The Birthplace of America", "Philadelpia, PA", "birthplace of america", "philadelpia pa", "philadelphia pennsylvania u s", "un locode usphl", "philadephia pennsylvania", "government of philadelphia", "city and county of philadelphia pennsylvania", "philidelphia", "philadelphia commuter rail", "philedelphia", "philladelphia", "philadelphia pa", "philadelpia pennsylvania", "philadelphia city", "philadelphia", "philadelphia pennsylvania us", "philadelphia pennsylvania", "political families of philadelphia", "philadelphia regional rail", "list of nicknames for philadelphia", "philadelphi", "phila", "philadelphia u s", "philadelphia suburban rail", "cradle of liberty", "philidalphia", "philadelphia usa", "city that loves you back", "philadelphia city pennsylvania", "city of brotherly love", "wiccacoa", "philadelphia united states", "philadelphia philadelphia county pennsylvania", "philadelphia city controller", "quaker city", "city of philadelphia", "philadelphia pennsylvania usa"], ["Apollo 17", "Apollo XVII", "Apollo17", "apollo xvii", "apollo17", "apollo 17"]], "question_ids": ["tc_2182", "tc_2191", "tc_2202", "tc_2208", "tc_2218"], "topic": "Grinch"}}

It tells the tale of a boy raised by apes in the jungle, much like our adventure here, where we are surrounded by the wonders of the North Pole!'\n\nThe children listened intently, their eyes wide with excitement. 'And speaking of adventures,' Daniel continued, 'motorized ambulances were first used in France, helping people in need just like we are on this journey to spread joy and cheer!'\n\nAs the train rolled on, the scenery outside transformed into a winter wonderland. 'Look!' one child exclaimed, pointing to a distant city. 'Is that Damascus, the oldest continually inhabited city in the world?' \n\n'Indeed!' Daniel replied with a smile. 'A place rich in history, just like our own journey filled with stories and magic.'\n\nFinally, as they approached the North Pole, the children spotted a magnificent structure in the distance. 'What is that beautiful building?' one child asked, eyes sparkling with wonder.\n\n'That,' said Daniel, 'is Saint Basil's Cathedral, a symbol of beauty and celebration, much like the spirit of Christmas we are here to embrace!'\n\nWith hearts full of joy and minds buzzing with new knowledge, the children knew this was a Christmas Eve they would never forget, all thanks to the magic of the Polar Express."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which orchestral conductor was married to one of the subjects of the film Hillary and Jackie?", "In what year was the first Tarzan novel published?", "In which country were motorized ambulances first used?", "Which Syrian city is said to be the oldest continually inhabited city in the world?", "What is the name of the cathedral in Red Square, Moscow?"], "answers": [["Daniel Barenboim and Wagner", "Daniel barenboim", "Daniel Barenboim", "daniel barenboim and wagner", "daniel barenboim"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and fourteen", "1914", "1914", "one thousand nine hundred and fourteen"], ["La Republique francaise", "Franciaorsz\u00e1g", "La Republique fran\u00e7aise", "Belle France", "FRANCE", "Republique fran\u00e7aise", "France", "Ranska", "Franciaorszag", "French Republic", "R\u00e9publique francaise", "R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise", "ISO 3166-1:FR", "Frankreich", "France (country)", "Etymology of France", "FrancE", "La R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise", "People of France", "Republic of France", "Fracne", "Le France", "The French Republic", "Republique francaise", "The Republic of France", "La R\u00e9publique francaise", "La France", "Rain in France", "Republic of france", "FRance", "Frakkland", "Climate of France", "Franse", "belle france", "etymology of france", "franciaorsz\u00e1g", "la republique fran\u00e7aise", "la france", "france", "climate of france", "franciaorszag", "la republique francaise", "iso 3166 1 fr", "france country", "french republic", "r\u00e9publique francaise", "republique fran\u00e7aise", "la r\u00e9publique francaise", "fracne", "rain in france", "le france", "r\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise", "la r\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise", "frankreich", "republic of france", "people of france", "ranska", "franse", "republique francaise", "frakkland"], ["Damascuc", "Damascos", "Emirate of Damascus", "Damascus", "City of jasmin", "Asia/Damascus", "Damaskos", "City of Jasmin", "Al Shamie", "Ash-Sh\u0101m", "\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642", "\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645", "Sultanate of Damascus", "Demographics of Damascus", "History of Damascus", "Ancient City of Damascus", "Al-Shami", "Damascus, SY", "Damascus in the middle ages", "Dimashq", "Damascus, Syria", "Ancient damascus", "Medieval damascus", "Classical damascus", "Capital of Syria", "Damaskus", "damascuc", "damaskos", "sultanate of damascus", "city of jasmin", "demographics of damascus", "damascos", "damascus sy", "capital of syria", "ancient damascus", "emirate of damascus", "history of damascus", "ash sh\u0101m", "al shami", "\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645", "damaskus", "dimashq", "al shamie", "asia damascus", "medieval damascus", "damascus", "ancient city of damascus", "damascus syria", "damascus in middle ages", "classical damascus", "\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642"], ["Cathedral of the Intercession", "Pokhrovsky Cathedral", "Pokhrovsky cathedral", "St. Basil's Cathedral", "St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral", "Saint Basil's", "Cathedral of St Basil", "Pokrovsky cathedral", "Pokrovsky Cathedral", "The Cathedral of Intercession of the Virgin on the Moat", "St Basil Cathedral", "Saint Basil Cathedral", "Pokrovskiy Cathedral (also known as Saint Basil's Cathedral)", "St Basil's Cathedral", "St. Basil's", "Saint Basil's Cathedral", "Intercession Cathedral", "st basil s", "st basil cathedral", "cathedral of intercession", "cathedral of intercession of virgin on moat", "st basil s cathedral", "pokrovskiy cathedral also known as saint basil s cathedral", "saint basil cathedral", "pokrovsky cathedral", "saint basil s", "saint basil s cathedral", "pokhrovsky cathedral", "intercession cathedral", "cathedral of st basil"]], "question_ids": ["tc_2350", "tc_2380", "tc_2400", "tc_2481", "tc_2505"], "topic": "Polar Express"}}

It was Sirius, the brightest star, guiding them through the darkness. Red exclaimed, 'Look! That star is as bright as 23 Suns! It must be leading us to the treasure!'\n\nSuddenly, they stumbled upon a magical room filled with colorful lights. 'These must be the primary colors of light!' Chuck shouted, as red, green, and blue beams danced around them. They realized that the treasure was not just gold but the knowledge of how to use these colors to create beautiful art.\n\nIn the corner of the room, they found a helium balloon floating gently. 'This balloon is so light, it reminds me of the second lightest element!' Bomb said, laughing. They decided to take the balloon with them as a symbol of their adventure.\n\nFinally, they reached the treasure chest, which was locked with a riddle. 'What is the value of Pi to three decimal places?' the chest asked. Red thought hard and confidently answered, '3.142!'

As she stood at the podium, she declared, 'You turn if you want to, but I\u2019m not turning back!' The crowd roared with approval.\n\nNearby, a snooker tournament was taking place, featuring the legendary Ronnie, known as 'The Grinder.' His skills were unmatched, and he drew a crowd of cheering fans. Judy and Nick Wilde, her sly fox partner, decided to take a break from the rally to watch the game.\n\nAs they enjoyed the match, they bumped into Michael, a retired fast bowler known as 'Whispering Death.' He shared stories of his glory days, offering advice on how to stay focused under pressure. 'Just like in snooker, timing is everything,' he said with a smile.\n\nSuddenly, they heard a commotion. Arthur, a friendly elephant, was frantically searching for his dog, Willy. 'He\u2019s gone missing!' Arthur exclaimed. Judy and Nick sprang into action, determined to help their friend.\n\nWith the clues they gathered from the rally, the snooker tournament, and Michael\u2019s wisdom, they pieced together the mystery.

He then met Master Shifu, who was reminiscing about the legendary Spitfire planes. \"Did you know they were produced by Supermarine?\" Shifu said, his eyes sparkling with nostalgia. Po nodded, intrigued by the stories of speed and agility.\n\nLater, while preparing his dish, Po hummed a tune he had heard from Tigress. \"Always sunny in a rich man's world,\" he sang, recalling the catchy lyrics from the song \"Money, Money, Money\" by ABBA. It made him think of how much he loved sharing food with his friends.\n\nAs the festival approached, Po learned that Pat Cash, the famous tennis player, would be attending. \"He won the men\u2019s singles title at Wimbledon in 1987!\" exclaimed Mantis, who was a big fan of tennis. Po was thrilled to think that such a champion would be at the festival.\n\nFinally, Po needed a special wand to add a magical touch to his dish. He remembered that Victor Krum\u2019s wand was made by Ollivander, the finest wand maker. \"Maybe I can find something special at the festival!\" Po thought, excitedly.\n\nWith all these elements combined, Po created a dish that was not only delicious but also filled with stories and memories.

One day, he stumbled upon a magical steam locomotive named Mallard, which had set the world speed record in July 1938, racing at an astonishing 126 mph on the East Coast Mainline in England.\n\nAs Bolt boarded the train, it whisked him away to a concert at The Apollo, where he saw Bono performing. The venue was alive with music, and Bono called it \u2018Rock and roll\u2019s great cathedral.\u2019\n\nSuddenly, the train took a sharp turn, and Bolt found himself in ancient China, where he met Bodhidharma, the Blue-Eyed Barbarian. Bodhidharma shared wisdom about mindfulness and meditation, teaching Bolt the importance of being present.\n\nThe train then zoomed to the year 1971, where Bolt witnessed the only hijacking of a British commercial flight. It was a tense moment, but Bolt learned about bravery and resilience from the passengers.\n\nFinally, the train arrived at a grand ocean liner, the Queen Mary, launched in 1906. Bolt marveled at its beauty and imagined the adventures it had seen across the seas.\n\nWith each stop, Bolt learned something new about history, music, and courage, making him appreciate the world around him even more."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 2, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "output_dir": "", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "bpp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 15999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What is the name of the steam locomotive which set the world speed record in July 1938 by reaching 126 mph on the East Coast Mainline  in England?", "Singer and musician Bono called which venue \u2018Rock and roll\u2019s great cathedral\u2019?", "Which 5th/6th Century Buddhist monk is described in Chinese texts as \u2018The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\u2019?", "Which year saw the only hijacking of a British commercial flight?", "What was the name of the Cunard ocean liner which was launched on 20th September 1906?"], "answers": [["Mallard Duck", "Mallards", "Platyrhynchos", "Mallard duck", "Anas platyrhynchos", "Anas boschas", "Mallard", "Wild Duck", "Stock Duck", "Wild Ducks", "Mallard ducks", "anas platyrhynchos", "mallard ducks", "anas boschas", "mallards", "wild duck", "stock duck", "mallard", "mallard duck", "platyrhynchos", "wild ducks"], ["Madison square garden", "Madison Square Garden IV", "The MSG", "M.S.G.", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Square Gardens", "Theatre at Madison Square", "Gilmores Garden", "Madison Square Garden 4", "Madison Square Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals Series of 1994", "MSG IV", "The M.S.G.", "Madison Square Garden (1968)", "Knicks-Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Madison Square Garden Training Center", "knicks rangers finals series of 1994", "m s g", "knicks\u2013rangers championship runs of 1994", "knicks\u2013rangers finals series of 1994", "madison garden", "msg iv", "madison square garden 1968", "madison square garden iv", "madison square garden training center", "madison square garden", "madison square gardens", "theatre at madison square", "knicks rangers championship runs of 1994", "gilmores garden", "msg", "madison square garden 4"], ["Da mo", "Bodhi-Dharma", "Tamo", "Bodidarma", "Bodhiharma", "Da Mo's cave", "Bodhidarma", "Bodhi Dharma", "Bodhidharma at Shaolin", "Bloodstream Sermon", "Bodhidharma", "bodidarma", "da mo s cave", "bodhidarma", "bloodstream sermon", "bodhi dharma", "tamo", "da mo", "bodhiharma", "bodhidharma", "bodhidharma at shaolin"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and seventy", "1970", "1970", "one thousand nine hundred and seventy"], ["Domain of Moor", "Mauretania Secunda", "Roman Mauretania", "Mauretanian Kingdom", "Ancient mauretania", "Kingdom of Mauretania", "Roman-Moorish kingdoms", "Roman-Moor Kingdoms", "Mauretania Prima", "List of Kings of Mauretania", "King of Mauretania", "Classical mauretania", "Mauretania Sitifensis", "Classical morocco", "Mauretania", "List of kings of Mauretania", "Sitifensis", "mauretania prima", "domain of moor", "classical morocco", "sitifensis", "king of mauretania", "mauretanian kingdom", "list of kings of mauretania", "roman moorish kingdoms", "roman moor kingdoms", "ancient mauretania", "classical mauretania", "mauretania sitifensis", "mauretania secunda", "kingdom of mauretania", "roman mauretania", "mauretania"]], "question_ids": ["qb_404", "qb_406", "qb_470", "qb_483", "qb_495"], "topic": "Bolt"}}

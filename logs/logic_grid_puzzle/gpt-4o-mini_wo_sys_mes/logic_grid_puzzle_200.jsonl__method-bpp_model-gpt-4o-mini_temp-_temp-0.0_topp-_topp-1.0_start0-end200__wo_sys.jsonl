Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The brain regions will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n--- \nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Superior Parietal Lobule; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Primary Visual Cortex; Hippocampus; Amygdala\n\nStart collaboration! \n\nSuperior Parietal Lobule: \"Let\u2019s analyze the task in detail. We need to use exactly the four numbers (6, 12, 1, 1) to construct 24. One approach is to consider common factors or combinations that can reach 24. For example, numbers like 12 and 6 are related by multiplication, but we should also explore addition or subtraction to hit the target. Let\u2019s try to construct potential solutions step by step.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the guidance! Here\u2019s my initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24.\"\nDorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s break that down: (1 + 1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, and 6 * 6 = 36. This solution is incorrect as it results in 36, not 24. We need to consider different combinations and avoid division in this way.\"\nPrimary Visual Cortex: \"Visually, I see the error. Multiplying 6 by itself gives us too high of a result. Let\u2019s imagine breaking down 24 into smaller components first, like through addition. For instance, 12 + 12 equals 24.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\"\nHippocampus: \"Wait a minute, this is close, but you\u2019ve introduced a 4, which is not part of the original numbers. Let\u2019s avoid using extra numbers and stick strictly to the provided set: 6, 12, 1, and 1.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"You\u2019re right, I overlooked that.

Let\u2019s use some of those to simplify the explanation.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"We should include vivid imagery to make the poem engaging.

The first letters spell out 'CHATGPT,' and the poem stays focused on the topic.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Good job! The information about quantum computing is accurate, but I think we can simplify it a bit more for children.\"\nLimbic System: \"The tone feels light, but we could make it even more playful.

The tone feels lighter and more playful.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"I agree. The explanation is even simpler now, and the playful language makes it more engaging for a child.\"\nHippocampus: \"I like how this reflects previous simple metaphors that work well for children. The playful nature helps.\"\nLimbic System: \"I love the playful tone! It's much more fun and engaging now.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"The imagery is vivid and clear, especially with 'juggling' and 'secrets.'

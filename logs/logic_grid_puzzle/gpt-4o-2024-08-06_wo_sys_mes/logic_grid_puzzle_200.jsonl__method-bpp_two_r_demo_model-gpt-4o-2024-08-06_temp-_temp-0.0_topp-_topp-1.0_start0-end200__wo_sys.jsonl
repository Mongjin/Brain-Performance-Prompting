We\u2019re supposed to multiply the values, not add them. Let's reapply the correct operation.\"\nFrontal Lobe: \"Good catch! Let's refocus on our goal: calculating power using multiplication. This will help us get the correct result.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thank you for the correction. I\u2019ll multiply instead: P=120\u00d72=240W.

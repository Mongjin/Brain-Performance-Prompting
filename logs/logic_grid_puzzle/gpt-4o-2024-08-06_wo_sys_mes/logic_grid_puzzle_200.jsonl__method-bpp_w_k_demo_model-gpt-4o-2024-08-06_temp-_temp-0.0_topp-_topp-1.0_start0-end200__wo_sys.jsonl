The brain regions will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is one example:\n--- \nExample Task: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid. \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Temporal Lobe; Limbic System; Occipital Lobe; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"We need to organize the poem into seven lines, with the first letters spelling 'CHATGPT.' The language should be simple enough for a ten-year-old, and we need to include basic explanations of quantum computing.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Let\u2019s recall the basics of quantum computing: it\u2019s a type of computer that uses qubits, allowing multiple states at once, unlike classical bits.

Let\u2019s use some of those to simplify the explanation.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"We should include vivid imagery to make the poem engaging. For example, comparing qubits to spinning tops or magic coins might help.\"\nLimbic System: \"Let\u2019s ensure the poem is fun and interesting for a child. Using playful words and a light tone will keep them engaged.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the input!

House 1: Cat lover, Pianist, Fantasy book enthusiast\n2. House 2: Not loafers, percussionist, fantasy book enthusiast, or history book buff\n3. House 3: Fish enthusiast, Flutist\n\nNow, let's deduce the remaining details:\n\n- The person in House 1 is eating bananas (since the fish enthusiast is to the right of the banana eater).\n- The person in House 2 must be eating apples (since oranges are to the right of the pianist).\n- The person in House 3 is eating oranges.\n\nNow, let's fill in the shoes:\n\n- The person in House 1 is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast is to the right of the person wearing running shoes).\n- The person in House 2 is wearing high heels.\n- The person in House 3 is wearing loafers.\n\nFinally, let's fill in the book preferences:\n\n- The person in House 1 is the fantasy book enthusiast.\n- The person in House 2 is the history book buff.\n- The person in House 3 is the science fiction book fanatic.\n\nFinal answer: The house number where the science fiction book fanatic lives is 3.\"", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1219, "completion_tokens": 706, "total_tokens": 1925, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_45cf54deae", "prompt": "When faced with a task, begin by identifying the brain regions that will contribute to solving the task.

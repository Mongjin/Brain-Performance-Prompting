I\u2019ll focus on how the numbers relate logically. For instance, combining 12 and 12 could give 24, but we need to find a way to use all the numbers. What about considering pairs of numbers and their divisors?\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"Let me automate part of this process. Based on past patterns, using multiplication and addition has frequently been successful in similar problems. Let\u2019s try pairing the numbers in various ways to find a straightforward solution.\"\nHippocampus: \"I recall a similar task where dividing 12 by 2 and then multiplying the result helped reach the target.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1 \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Parietal Lobe; Basal Ganglia; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"To solve this, we need to create a clear plan that systematically tests different combinations. Let's explore operations that involve 6, 12, 1, and 1 to see which can lead to 24. I'll start by suggesting we explore combinations of multiplication and addition first.\"\nParietal Lobe: \"I agree. I\u2019ll focus on how the numbers relate logically. For instance, combining 12 and 12 could give 24, but we need to find a way to use all the numbers. What about considering pairs of numbers and their divisors?\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"Let me automate part of this process. Based on past patterns, using multiplication and addition has frequently been successful in similar problems. Let\u2019s try pairing the numbers in various ways to find a straightforward solution.\"\nHippocampus: \"I recall a similar task where dividing 12 by 2 and then multiplying the result helped reach the target. This past experience might be useful here.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"I see! Here\u2019s my first attempt: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\"\nFrontal Lobe: \"Good try, but let\u2019s ensure the operations use the exact numbers in the input and no extra ones. You can't use the number 4. Can you adjust this?\"\nParietal Lobe: \"Try using only 6, 12, 1, and 1 and avoid introducing 4 in the division.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks! Here's a revised solution: (6 * (1 + 1)) + 12 = 24.\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"I\u2019ll double-check the math: 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 24. This looks correct!\"\nHippocampus: \"Yes, this pattern matches previous solutions. Everything seems to fit.\"\nFrontal Lobe: \"We\u2019ve verified the solution. Excellent!\"\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24.\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid. \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Temporal Lobe; Limbic System; Occipital Lobe; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"We need to organize the poem into seven lines, with the first letters spelling 'CHATGPT.' The language should be simple enough for a ten-year-old, and we need to include basic explanations of quantum computing.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Let\u2019s recall the basics of quantum computing: it\u2019s a type of computer that uses qubits, allowing multiple states at once, unlike classical bits. I\u2019ll provide this key information for the poem.\"\nHippocampus: \"I recall some basic metaphors used in the past to explain complex ideas to children. Let\u2019s use some of those to simplify the explanation.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"We should include vivid imagery to make the poem engaging. For example, comparing qubits to spinning tops or magic coins might help.\"\nLimbic System: \"Let\u2019s ensure the poem is fun and interesting for a child. Using playful words and a light tone will keep them engaged.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the input! Here\u2019s my first attempt:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm\u2019s odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\"\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"The structure looks correct. The first letters spell out 'CHATGPT,' and the poem stays focused on the topic.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Good job! The information about quantum computing is accurate, but I think we can simplify it a bit more for children.\"\nLimbic System: \"The tone feels light, but we could make it even more playful. Maybe add a bit more fun language.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! I\u2019ll simplify and adjust the tone. Let me revise it:\nCurious machine, what a wonder!\nHarnessing strange quantum thunder,\nAtoms play, two states they juggle,\nTaking secrets with a giggle.\n\nGreat at solving, fast and neat,\nPuzzles that no one else can beat,\nTomorrow's future, what a treat!\"\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"This version also maintains the structure with 'CHATGPT.' The tone feels lighter and more playful.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"I agree. The explanation is even simpler now, and the playful language makes it more engaging for a child.\"\nHippocampus: \"I like how this reflects previous simple metaphors that work well for children. The playful nature helps.\"\nLimbic System: \"I love the playful tone! It's much more fun and engaging now.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"The imagery is vivid and clear, especially with 'juggling' and 'secrets.' This should help kids visualize the concept better.\"\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine, what a wonder!\nHarnessing strange quantum thunder,\nAtoms play, two states they juggle,\nTaking secrets with a giggle.\n\nGreat at solving, fast and neat,\nPuzzles that no one else can beat,\nTomorrow's future, what a treat!\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Also, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person with a television.\"\n\nHippocampus: \"I remember similar logic puzzles. We should use a process of elimination to figure out the positions.\"\n\nAI Assistant (you): \"Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house. So, House 1 is the mystery book reader.\n2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. Therefore, the history book buff must be in House 2.\n3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television. So, the person with a television is in House 2.\n4. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1 \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Parietal Lobe; Basal Ganglia; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"To solve this, we need to create a clear plan that systematically tests different combinations. Let's explore operations that involve 6, 12, 1, and 1 to see which can lead to 24. I'll start by suggesting we explore combinations of multiplication and addition first.\"\nParietal Lobe: \"I agree. I\u2019ll focus on how the numbers relate logically. For instance, combining 12 and 12 could give 24, but we need to find a way to use all the numbers. What about considering pairs of numbers and their divisors?\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"Let me automate part of this process. Based on past patterns, using multiplication and addition has frequently been successful in similar problems. Let\u2019s try pairing the numbers in various ways to find a straightforward solution.\"\nHippocampus: \"I recall a similar task where dividing 12 by 2 and then multiplying the result helped reach the target. This past experience might be useful here.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"I see! Here\u2019s my first attempt: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\"\nFrontal Lobe: \"Good try, but let\u2019s ensure the operations use the exact numbers in the input and no extra ones. You can't use the number 4. Can you adjust this?\"\nParietal Lobe: \"Try using only 6, 12, 1, and 1 and avoid introducing 4 in the division.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks! Here's a revised solution: (6 * (1 + 1)) + 12 = 24.\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"I\u2019ll double-check the math: 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 24.

(3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid. \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Temporal Lobe; Limbic System; Occipital Lobe; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"We need to organize the poem into seven lines, with the first letters spelling 'CHATGPT.' The language should be simple enough for a ten-year-old, and we need to include basic explanations of quantum computing.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Let\u2019s recall the basics of quantum computing: it\u2019s a type of computer that uses qubits, allowing multiple states at once, unlike classical bits. I\u2019ll provide this key information for the poem.\"\nHippocampus: \"I recall some basic metaphors used in the past to explain complex ideas to children. Let\u2019s use some of those to simplify the explanation.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"We should include vivid imagery to make the poem engaging. For example, comparing qubits to spinning tops or magic coins might help.\"\nLimbic System: \"Let\u2019s ensure the poem is fun and interesting for a child. Using playful words and a light tone will keep them engaged.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the input!

The first letters spell out 'CHATGPT,' and the poem stays focused on the topic.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"Good job! The information about quantum computing is accurate, but I think we can simplify it a bit more for children.\"\nLimbic System: \"The tone feels light, but we could make it even more playful. Maybe add a bit more fun language.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! I\u2019ll simplify and adjust the tone.

The tone feels lighter and more playful.\"\nTemporal Lobe: \"I agree. The explanation is even simpler now, and the playful language makes it more engaging for a child.\"\nHippocampus: \"I like how this reflects previous simple metaphors that work well for children. The playful nature helps.\"\nLimbic System: \"I love the playful tone! It's much more fun and engaging now.\"\nOccipital Lobe: \"The imagery is vivid and clear, especially with 'juggling' and 'secrets.' This should help kids visualize the concept better.\"\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine, what a wonder!\nHarnessing strange quantum thunder,\nAtoms play, two states they juggle,\nTaking secrets with a giggle.\n\nGreat at solving, fast and neat,\nPuzzles that no one else can beat,\nTomorrow's future, what a treat!\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

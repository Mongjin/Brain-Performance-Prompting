The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.\n\nLet's start by considering the clues that give us direct relationships:\n\n- From clue 7, the person eating oranges is directly left of the person with a television. This means the person with a television cannot be in house 1, so they must be in house 2 or 3.\n\n- From clue 2, the person eating kiwis is to the left of the person eating oranges. Therefore, the person eating kiwis must be in house 1, and the person eating oranges must be in house 2. Consequently, the person with a television must be in house 3.\n\n- From clue 5, the person eating kiwis is to the left of the person wearing boots. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3.\n\n- From clue 6, the person with a radio is to the left of the person wearing high heels. Since the person with a radio cannot be in house 3 (as the person with a television is there), they must be in house 1 or 2. The person wearing high heels must be in house 2 or 3.\n\n- From clue 3, the person wearing high heels and the pianist are directly next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1 (clue 1), they must be in house 2 or 3. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2, and the pianist must be in house 3.\n\n- From clue 4, the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist are directly next to each other. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 1, and the percussionist must be in house 2.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Person eating kiwis, wearing running shoes, has a radio.\n- House 2: Person eating oranges, wearing high heels, is a percussionist.\n- House 3: Person with a television, wearing boots, is a pianist.\n\nTherefore, the person who has a television lives in house 3.\n\nAnswer:\n3", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens": 608, "total_tokens": 953, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_9e15ccd6a4", "prompt": "Q: There are 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 3 on the right.

Therefore, the person eating a banana must be in house 2 or house 4.\n\nFrom clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1, and the person who only drinks water cannot be in house 5.\n\nFrom clue 6, there are two houses between the root beer lover and the person eating kiwis. This means one of them must be in house 1 and the other in house 4, or one in house 2 and the other in house 5.\n\nFrom clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk (house 3).

There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.\n11. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.\n\nLet's start solving:\n\n- From clue 6, the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.\n- From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house.\n- From clue 2, the person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house, so they must live in house 2 or 3.\n- From clue 3, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in house 3 or 4.\n- From clue 10, there is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives. This means if the truck is in house 2, green is in house 4; if the truck is in house 3, green is in house 1.\n- From clue 5, the person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck. This means loafers can be in house 1 or 2 if the truck is in house 3.\n- From clue 8, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck. This means boots can be in house 1 or 2 if the truck is in house 3.\n- From clue 4, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means yellow can be in house 1 or 2, and red can be in house 3 or 5.\n- From clue 7, there are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives. This means sedan can be in house 1 or 4, and running shoes can be in house 3 or 5.\n- From clue 11, the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house. This means SUV can be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet's try to place the truck in house 3:\n- If the truck is in house 3, sandals must be in house 4.\n- If the truck is in house 3, green must be in house 1.\n- If the truck is in house 3, loafers and boots must be in house 1 or 2.\n- If the truck is in house 3, yellow can be in house 1 or 2, and red can be in house 5.\n- If the truck is in house 3, sedan can be in house 1, and running shoes can be in house 4.\n- If the truck is in house 3, SUV can be in house 2, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, let's try to place the truck in house 2:\n- If the truck is in house 2, sandals must be in house 3.\n- If the truck is in house 2, green must be in house 4.\n- If the truck is in house 2, loafers and boots must be in house 1.\n- If the truck is in house 2, yellow can be in house 1, and red can be in house 3 or 5.\n- If the truck is in house 2, sedan can be in house 4, and running shoes can be in house 1.\n- If the truck is in house 2, SUV can be in house 3, 4, or 5.\n\nAfter trying both scenarios, the only consistent solution is:\n- House 1: Yellow, Running Shoes, Loafers, Sedan\n- House 2: Truck, Boots\n- House 3: Sandals, Red, SUV\n- House 4: White, Green, Minivan\n- House 5: Blue, Convertible\n\nTherefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 2.\n\nAnswer:\n2", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 434, "completion_tokens": 1055, "total_tokens": 1489, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_5050236cbd", "prompt": "Q: There are 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 5 on the right.

There are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives.\n10. The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.\n\nLet's start by placing the known positions:\n\n- House 4: Violinist (Clue 8)\n- House 5: Bird keeper (Clue 10)\n\nFrom Clue 4 and Clue 7, we know:\n- The flutist is directly left of the person with a television, and the person with a television is directly left of the person with a gameboy. This means the flutist is in House 2, the person with a television is in House 3, and the person with a gameboy is in House 4.\n\nFrom Clue 5, the person with a television is to the left of the person with a radio. Since the person with a gameboy is in House 4, the person with a radio must be in House 5.\n\nFrom Clue 6, the guitarist is to the right of the percussionist. The only available positions for the percussionist and guitarist are Houses 1 and 2. Therefore, the percussionist is in House 1, and the guitarist is in House 2.\n\nNow, let's place the pets:\n- The bird keeper is in House 5.\n- From Clue 3, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses are next to each other. The only available adjacent houses are Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3. Since the flutist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in Houses 1 and 2. Let's assume the fish enthusiast is in House 1 and the person who owns horses is in House 2.\n\nFinally, let's place the devices:\n- The person with a phone must be in House 1 or 3, as there are two houses between the phone and the horses (Clue 9). Since the person with a television is in House 3, the person with a phone must be in House 1.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Percussionist, Fish enthusiast, Phone\n- House 2: Guitarist, Horses, Flutist\n- House 3: Television\n- House 4: Violinist, Gameboy\n- House 5: Bird keeper, Radio\n\nTherefore, the percussionist lives in House 1.\n\nAnswer:\n1", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 389, "completion_tokens": 678, "total_tokens": 1067, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_5050236cbd", "prompt": "Q: There are 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 5 on the right.

The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.\n\nLet's start filling in the information:\n\n- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 11)\n- House 4: Eating a banana (Clue 15)\n\nFrom Clue 14, the person with the gameboy and the person eating grapes are two houses apart. From Clue 17, the person with the gameboy is directly left of the person eating oranges. This means:\n\n- House 1: Gameboy\n- House 2: Oranges\n- House 5: Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 10, the person with the truck is directly left of the person with the gameboy:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy\n- House 2: Oranges\n- House 5: Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 6, the person eating oranges is directly left of the person with the sedan:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan\n- House 5: Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 19, the person with the sedan is directly left of the person with the minivan:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan\n- House 3: Minivan\n- House 5: Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 12, the person who had stew is directly left of the person with the radio. Since House 1 has the gameboy, House 2 must have the radio:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan, Radio\n- House 3: Minivan\n- House 5: Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 8, there is one house between the person who had stew and the person who had pizza. Since House 2 has the radio, House 1 must have had stew, and House 3 must have had pizza:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy, Stew\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan, Radio\n- House 3: Minivan, Pizza\n- House 5: Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 9, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person eating grapes. This is consistent with the current setup.\n\nFrom Clue 16, the romance book lover and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other. Since the romance book lover cannot be in House 5 (Clue 3), they must be in House 4, and the mystery book reader must be in House 5:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy, Stew\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan, Radio\n- House 3: Minivan, Pizza\n- House 4: Romance, Banana\n- House 5: Mystery, Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 18, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other. Since House 4 has the romance book lover and House 5 has the mystery book reader, House 3 must have the phone, and House 2 must have had grilled cheese:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy, Stew\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan, Radio, Grilled Cheese\n- House 3: Minivan, Pizza, Phone\n- House 4: Romance, Banana\n- House 5: Mystery, Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 7, the person with the television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since House 1 has the gameboy, House 1 must also have the television:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy, Stew, Television\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan, Radio, Grilled Cheese\n- House 3: Minivan, Pizza, Phone\n- House 4: Romance, Banana\n- House 5: Mystery, Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 13, the person eating kiwis does not live in the first house. Since House 4 has the banana and House 5 has the grapes, House 2 must have the kiwis:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy, Stew, Television\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan, Radio, Grilled Cheese, Kiwis\n- House 3: Minivan, Pizza, Phone\n- House 4: Romance, Banana\n- House 5: Mystery, Grapes\n\nFrom Clue 4, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house. Since House 2 has grilled cheese and House 3 has pizza, House 4 must have had fried rice:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy, Stew, Television\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan, Radio, Grilled Cheese, Kiwis\n- House 3: Minivan, Pizza, Phone\n- House 4: Romance, Banana, Fried Rice\n- House 5: Mystery, Grapes\n\nFinally, from Clue 1, the person who drives a convertible does not live in the second house. Since House 1 has the truck and House 3 has the minivan, House 4 must have the convertible:\n\n- House 1: Truck, Gameboy, Stew, Television\n- House 2: Oranges, Sedan, Radio, Grilled Cheese, Kiwis\n- House 3: Minivan, Pizza, Phone\n- House 4: Romance, Banana, Fried Rice, Convertible\n- House 5: Mystery, Grapes\n\nTherefore, the mystery book reader lives in House 5.\n\nAnswer:\n5", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 655, "completion_tokens": 1531, "total_tokens": 2186, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_5050236cbd", "prompt": "Q: There are 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 5 on the right.

The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.\n11. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.\n\nLet's start by placing the clues:\n\n- From clue 2 and 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of both the tea drinker and the person who likes yellow. This means the pizza eater must be in house 1 or 2, and the tea drinker in house 2 or 3, and the person who likes yellow in house 3 or 4.\n\n- From clue 7, the person eating oranges is directly left of the person eating apples. This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person eating apples in house 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- From clue 11, the person eating apples is to the right of the person who had pizza. This means the person eating apples cannot be in house 1.\n\n- From clue 9, the person who had stew is directly left of the person who drinks water. This means the stew eater must be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the water drinker in house 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- From clue 8, the person who had stew is not in house 3. So, the stew eater must be in house 1 or 2, and the water drinker in house 2 or 3.\n\n- From clue 10, the person who likes white is to the right of the person who had stew. This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 1.\n\n- From clue 3, there are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means one of them must be in house 1 and the other in house 4, or one in house 2 and the other in house 3.\n\n- From clue 1, the root beer lover and the milk lover are next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's try to place these:\n\n- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the milk lover is in house 2. The grilled cheese eater would then be in house 4. This doesn't work with the other clues.\n\n- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the milk lover is in house 3. The grilled cheese eater would then be in house 1. This doesn't work with the other clues.\n\n- If the root beer lover is in house 3, the milk lover is in house 4. The grilled cheese eater would then be in house 1. This works with the other clues.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining:\n\n- The person who had pizza must be in house 1 (since they are directly left of the tea drinker and the person who likes yellow, who must be in house 3 or 4).\n\n- The tea drinker must be in house 2.\n\n- The person who likes yellow must be in house 3.\n\n- The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since they are directly left of the person eating apples, who must be in house 3 or 4).\n\n- The person eating apples must be in house 4.\n\n- The person who had stew must be in house 1 (since they are directly left of the water drinker, who must be in house 2).\n\n- The person who likes white must be in house 4 (since they are to the right of the person who had stew).\n\n- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (since there is one house between them and the person who likes yellow, who is in house 3).\n\n- The person eating mangos must be in house 1 (since there is one house between them and the person eating oranges, who is in house 2).\n\n- The person who likes blue must be in house 1 (since the only remaining color is blue).\n\n- The person who likes milk must be in house 4 (since the only remaining drink is milk).\n\nNow, we have:\n\nHouse 1: Pizza, Mangos, Blue, Stew\nHouse 2: Tea, Oranges, Red, Water\nHouse 3: Yellow, Apples, Root Beer\nHouse 4: White, Milk, Grilled Cheese\n\nThe person eating apples is in house 3.\n\nAnswer:\n3", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 441, "completion_tokens": 1139, "total_tokens": 1580, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_5050236cbd", "prompt": "Q: There are 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 4 on the right.

This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 1 or 2, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since the person in house 4 drives a convertible, the person who likes white must be in house 3, and the person eating a banana must be in house 2.\n\nFrom clue 11, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Therefore, the person in house 2 drives a minivan.\n\nFrom clue 10, the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person eating a banana is in house 2, the person who owns an SUV must be in house 1 or 3. However, from clue 8, the person who owns an SUV does not live in house 2, so they must be in house 1.\n\nFrom clue 12, the person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV is in house 1, the person who likes blue must be in house 2.\n\nNow, let's place the sports:\n\n- From clue 3, the soccer player does not live in house 4. \n- From clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 1 or 2.\n- From clue 14, there is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. This means the swimmer cannot be in house 2, as there would be no room for the cricketer. Therefore, the swimmer must be in house 1, and the cricketer must be in house 3.\n\nThis leaves the soccer player and the basketball player. Since the soccer player cannot be in house 4 (clue 3), the soccer player must be in house 2, and the basketball player must be in house 4.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Likes yellow, eating kiwis, owns an SUV, is a swimmer.\n- House 2: Likes blue, eating a banana, drives a minivan, is a soccer player.\n- House 3: Likes white, eating mangos, drives a truck, is a cricketer.\n- House 4: Likes green, eating oranges, drives a convertible, is a basketball player.\n\nAnswer:\n4", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens": 853, "total_tokens": 1329, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_5050236cbd", "prompt": "Q: There are 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 4 on the right.

The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.\n16. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.\n\nLet's start by placing the clues that give us the most direct information:\n\n- Clue 7 and 15 tell us that the person with the carnations arrangement does not live in house 3 or 5, so they must live in house 1, 2, or 4.\n\n- Clue 1 tells us that the computer is directly left of the root beer lover. This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 1.\n\n- Clue 3 tells us that the root beer lover and the coffee drinker are next to each other. \n\n- Clue 14 tells us there is one house between the daffodils and the coffee drinker. \n\n- Clue 5 tells us the daffodils are to the left of the cellist.\n\n- Clue 9 tells us the cellist is not in house 4, and clue 8 tells us there is one house between the cellist and the guitarist.\n\n- Clue 12 tells us the root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist.\n\n- Clue 13 tells us the root beer lover is to the left of the lilies.\n\n- Clue 16 tells us the tea drinker is to the left of the pianist.\n\nBy combining these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3 or 5, and since the root beer lover and coffee drinker are next to each other, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 2 (as it would force the root beer lover and coffee drinker to be in 3 and 4, which doesn't work with other clues). Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in house 1 or 4.\n\n- If the carnations arrangement is in house 1, then the root beer lover could be in house 2, and the coffee drinker in house 3. This would allow the daffodils to be in house 1, the lilies in house 4, and the cellist in house 5, which fits all the conditions.\n\n- If the carnations arrangement is in house 4, it would not fit with the other clues, as it would disrupt the placement of the root beer lover, coffee drinker, and other arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent solution is that the carnations arrangement is in house 1.\n\nAnswer:\n1", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 580, "completion_tokens": 811, "total_tokens": 1391, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_5050236cbd", "prompt": "Q: There are 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 5 on the right.

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.\n5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.\n6. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.\n7. The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.\n8. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer.\n9. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.\n10. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.\n11. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.\n12. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.\n13. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.\n14. The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.\n15. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.\n16. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.\n17. There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.\n\nLet's start by placing the known positions:\n- House 2: Dog owner (Clue 3)\n- House 3: Fish enthusiast (Clue 6)\n\nFrom Clue 13, the minivan driver is to the right of the dog owner, so they must be in house 4 or 5.\n\nFrom Clue 8, the truck driver is directly left of the computer owner. From Clue 12, there are two houses between the truck driver and the convertible driver. This means the truck driver must be in house 1, the computer owner in house 2, and the convertible driver in house 4.\n\nFrom Clue 17, the television owner and SUV owner have one house between them. Since the computer is in house 2, the television must be in house 1 or 3, and the SUV in house 3 or 5. The only possibility is television in house 1 and SUV in house 5.\n\nNow, let's place the flowers:\n- From Clue 15, carnations and tulips are next to each other. Carnations can't be in house 5 (Clue 16), so they must be in house 1 or 2. If carnations are in house 1, tulips must be in house 2, but house 2 already has a computer. So, carnations are in house 2, tulips in house 1.\n\nFrom Clue 11, tulips and convertible are next to each other, which fits with tulips in house 1 and convertible in house 4.\n\nFrom Clue 10, tulips are to the left of horses, so horses must be in house 5.\n\nNow, let's place the devices:\n- From Clue 2, gameboy is to the left of radio. Gameboy can't be in house 2 (Clue 7), so it must be in house 1. Radio must be in house 4 or 5. Since house 4 has a convertible, radio is in house 5.\n\nFinally, let's place the remaining flowers:\n- From Clue 4, daffodils are to the left of the truck, so daffodils are in house 1.\n- From Clue 5, lilies are not in house 5, so they must be in house 4.\n- Roses are the only flowers left, so they are in house 3.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n- House 1: Gameboy, Truck, Daffodils, Bird keeper\n- House 2: Computer, Sedan, Carnations, Dog owner\n- House 3: Television, SUV, Roses, Fish enthusiast\n- House 4: Phone, Convertible, Lilies, Cat lover\n- House 5: Radio, Minivan, Tulips, Horses\n\nThe person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 5.\n\nAnswer:\n5", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 610, "completion_tokens": 967, "total_tokens": 1577, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_7568d46099", "prompt": "Q: There are 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 5 on the right.

Since house 4 is occupied by boots, sandals must be in house 1, 2, or 3.\n\nFrom clue 8, the person with daffodils and the person wearing running shoes are next to each other.

However, lilies cannot be in house 5 because carnations are there. Therefore, running shoes cannot be in house 3.\n\nLet's assume running shoes are in house 1, then lilies would be in house 3. This means daffodils must be in house 2 (since they are next to running shoes in house 1).\n\nNow, let's place the tulips and loafers. From clue 2, tulips are directly left of loafers.

Since pizza is in house 4, gameboy cannot be in house 2, and since radio is in house 3, gameboy cannot be in house 3. Therefore, gameboy must be in house 5, and fried rice must be in house 3.\n\n8. From clue 1, the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since gameboy is in house 5, computer must be in house 4.\n\n9. From clue 2, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone. Since computer is in house 4 and gameboy is in house 5, television must be in house 1, 2, or 3, and phone must be in house 2, 3, or 5. The only arrangement that fits is television in house 1 and phone in house 3.\n\n10. Now, we have:\n   - House 1: Television, Grilled Cheese\n   - House 2: Radio, Spaghetti\n   - House 3: Phone, Fried Rice\n   - House 4: Computer, Pizza\n   - House 5: Gameboy, Stew\n\nTherefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.\n\nAnswer:\n2", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 339, "completion_tokens": 683, "total_tokens": 1022, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_7568d46099", "prompt": "Q: There are 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 5 on the right.

This means the mystery book reader cannot be in house 4, as there wouldn't be enough room for the history book buff to be one house away.\n\nUsing clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader cannot be in house 5.\n\nUsing clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.\n\nNow, let's try to place the percussionist in house 4. This would mean the person who had stew is in house 5, and the guitarist is in house 3.

The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.\n14. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.\n\nLet's start by placing the clues that give us direct relationships:\n\n- Clue 2: The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. This means they must be in consecutive houses.\n- Clue 3: The basketball player and the tennis player live directly next to each other.\n- Clue 4: The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.\n- Clue 5: The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.\n- Clue 13: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.\n\nNow, let's try to place these pairs in the houses:\n\n- From Clue 5, the tea drinker must be in a house directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5.\n- From Clue 9, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 1.\n- From Clue 10, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 2 if the water drinker is in house 1.\n\nLet's try placing the tea drinker in house 3:\n\n- If the tea drinker is in house 3, then the person who had pizza is in house 4.\n- From Clue 7, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. This means the cricketer could be in house 5.\n- From Clue 6, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the stew eater could be in house 1 or 2, and the soccer player could be in house 4 or 5.\n- From Clue 14, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the tennis player could be in house 4 or 5.\n\nLet's try placing the tea drinker in house 2:\n\n- If the tea drinker is in house 2, then the person who had pizza is in house 3.\n- From Clue 7, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. This means the cricketer could be in house 4 or 5.\n- From Clue 6, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the stew eater could be in house 1, and the soccer player could be in house 3, 4, or 5.\n- From Clue 14, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the tennis player could be in house 3, 4, or 5.\n\nAfter testing these possibilities, the only consistent solution is:\n\n- House 1: Stew eater, wearing sandals, water drinker, cricketer\n- House 2: Tea drinker, wearing boots, basketball player\n- House 3: Pizza eater, wearing loafers, tennis player\n- House 4: Grilled cheese eater, wearing high heels, soccer player\n- House 5: Spaghetti eater, wearing running shoes, root beer lover\n\nTherefore, the tea drinker lives in house 2.\n\nAnswer:\n2", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 505, "completion_tokens": 975, "total_tokens": 1480, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_143bb8492c", "prompt": "Q: There are 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 5 on the right.

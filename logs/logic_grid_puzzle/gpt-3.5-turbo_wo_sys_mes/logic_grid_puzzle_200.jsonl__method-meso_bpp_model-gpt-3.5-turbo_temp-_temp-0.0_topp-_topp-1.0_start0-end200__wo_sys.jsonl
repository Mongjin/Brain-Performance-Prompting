The person with the computer cannot be in house 1, so they must be in house 3. This means the person with the phone is in house 1. Now, we can determine the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives.\"\n\nHippocampus: \"Let's review the clues and the deductions we've made so far to ensure we're on the right track.\"\n\nAngular Gyrus: \"Given the information we have, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 2. The mystery book reader is in house 1, the history book buff is in house 3, and the person with the computer is in house 3. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 2.\"\n\nAmygdala: \"Great work, team!

Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The brain regions will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary. \n \nHere are some examples:\n--- \nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Superior Parietal Lobule; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Primary Visual Cortex; Hippocampus; Amygdala\n\nStart collaboration! \n\nSuperior Parietal Lobule: \"Let\u2019s analyze the task in detail. We need to use exactly the four numbers (6, 12, 1, 1) to construct 24. One approach is to consider common factors or combinations that can reach 24. For example, numbers like 12 and 6 are related by multiplication, but we should also explore addition or subtraction to hit the target. Let\u2019s try to construct potential solutions step by step.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the guidance! Here\u2019s my initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24.\"\nDorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s break that down: (1 + 1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, and 6 * 6 = 36. This solution is incorrect as it results in 36, not 24. We need to consider different combinations and avoid division in this way.\"\nPrimary Visual Cortex: \"Visually, I see the error. Multiplying 6 by itself gives us too high of a result. Let\u2019s imagine breaking down 24 into smaller components first, like through addition. For instance, 12 + 12 equals 24.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\"\nHippocampus: \"Wait a minute, this is close, but you\u2019ve introduced a 4, which is not part of the original numbers. Let\u2019s avoid using extra numbers and stick strictly to the provided set: 6, 12, 1, and 1.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"You\u2019re right, I overlooked that. Here is a revised solution considering only the provided numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\"\nAmygdala: \"Hmm, I appreciate the effort, but you\u2019re very close! The subtraction might be causing the issue. Let\u2019s try changing it to an addition. Keep up the great work, we\u2019re almost there!\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Got it! Here\u2019s the corrected solution: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24.\"\nSuperior Parietal Lobule: \"Let\u2019s check it step by step: 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, and 12 + 12 = 24. The solution works, and all the numbers were used correctly.\"\nAmygdala: \"Great job! This feels satisfying now that we\u2019ve nailed it.

(3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid. \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex; Hippocampus; Angular Gyrus; Visual Association Cortex; Amygdala\n\nDorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s begin by considering the structural requirements of this poem. It needs to have seven lines, and the first letters of each line should form 'CHATGPT.' Additionally, the content should explain a quantum computer in simple terms, appropriate for a ten-year-old.\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the guidance! Here\u2019s my initial attempt at the poem: \nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGreat power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\"\n\nVentromedial Prefrontal Cortex: \"The poem has a nice structure and flow, but the language might be a bit too complex for a child. For example, 'perplex' is a difficult word. Let\u2019s try to simplify the tone to make it more accessible.\"\nHippocampus: \"I agree with simplifying it. Also, using relatable concepts like 'spinning tops' or 'magic coins' could help explain quantum superposition in a way that children can understand.\"\nAngular Gyrus: \"Instead of 'entwined in dual state,' we could say 'two states they embrace,' which is simpler and still retains the quantum concept. Also, 'puzzling maze' might replace 'haze' for a clearer visual.\"\nAmygdala: \"I think simplifying the language will make the poem more emotionally engaging for children. We need to ensure it feels fun and magical so they stay interested!\"\nAI Assistant (you): \"Thanks for the feedback! Here\u2019s the revised version: \nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\"\n\nDorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: \"Let\u2019s check the structure: the first letters of each line spell out 'CHATGPT,' which is correct. The simplified language works well.\"\nVentromedial Prefrontal Cortex: \"The tone now feels much more appropriate for children. It\u2019s easy to follow and emotionally engaging.\"\nHippocampus: \"Yes, the concept of quantum computing is clearly explained in simple terms. Children should find this easy to understand.\"\nAmygdala: \"Perfect! This version is much more enjoyable and fun.

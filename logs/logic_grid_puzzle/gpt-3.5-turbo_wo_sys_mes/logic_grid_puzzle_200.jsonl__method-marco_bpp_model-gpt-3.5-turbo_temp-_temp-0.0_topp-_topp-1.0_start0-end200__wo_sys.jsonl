You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1 \n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Frontal Lobe; Parietal Lobe; Basal Ganglia; Hippocampus\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nFrontal Lobe: \"To solve this, we need to create a clear plan that systematically tests different combinations.

I\u2019ll focus on how the numbers relate logically. For instance, combining 12 and 12 could give 24, but we need to find a way to use all the numbers. What about considering pairs of numbers and their divisors?\"\nBasal Ganglia: \"Let me automate part of this process.
